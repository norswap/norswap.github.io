      <h1 class="post-title">What We (Don&#39;t) Know About Nutrition: Red Meat</h1>
      <span class="post-date">26 Jan 2020</span>
<p>While I was writing another article related to nutrition (coming out soon), I
found myself plunging rather deep in a particular nutritional rabbit-hole.
Namely: is red meat consumption bad for you?</p>
<p>The commonly accepted idea is that it is. But as we&#39;ll see, there actually is
little evidence that it is the case.</p>
<p>I think my investigation of this is an excellent way to demonstrate quite a few
interesting ideas:</p>
<h4>It's incredibly difficult to link diet to health outcomes, and the impact
variations in reasonable diets have is fairly small.</h4>

<p>This was the original point I was trying to make with the red meat litterature
example.</p>
<p>If you have no egregious nutrient deficiencies and you keep your bodyfat
percentage in check, I believe the impact of nutrition on your long-term health
will be a couple percents (at best) change in the chance to get or not get some
kind of cancer, etc.</p>
<p>You should also sleep well and do some exercise, but those are
non-nutrition-related.</p>
<h4>You shouldn't necessarily trust the consensus in some branches of science (like nutrition).</h4>

<p>However, that doesn&#39;t mean you should just stick to whatever opinion you had
before, which is probably not based on facts, or merely on anecdote.</p>
<p>Instead, you should research the topic yourself (preferrably) or find people
whose scientific judgement you trust (not easy, people tend to pick a camp).</p>
<h4>It's hard to do good science.</h4>

<p>Even the published litterature is rife with confounders and bias. And people
forget that correlation doesn&#39;t imply causation.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also some bad faith going on in some higher instances.</p>
<p>Bonus: cool Slate Star Codex articles about confounders: <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/26/stop-confounding-yourself-stop-confounding-yourself/">one</a>,
<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/24/you-need-more-confounders/">two</a>.</p>
<h4>Absence of evidence is evidence of absence.</h4>

<p>I stole this one from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mnS2WYLCGJP2kQkRn/absence-of-evidence-is-evidence-of-absence">LessWrong</a>, but basically it means that if you try to
find evidence of X (e.g. red meat increases mortality), and you find none or
very little, that&#39;s evidence that X is probably not true.</p>
<p>And last but not least:</p>
<h4>Relax, that ribeye steak is probably not going to kill you.</h4>

<p>So let&#39;s get right into it.</p>
<h2 id="anecdotes-and-confounders">Anecdotes and Confounders</h2>
<p>It&#39;s easy to find exemples of people who&#39;ve follow a non-conventional diet
(veganism, keto, carnivore) for a long time and seem to be doing quite fine.
It&#39;s also easy to find the opposite, but if you dig, you&#39;ll often find other
factors that can explain adverse health outcomes. The only way to link food and
health outcomes is to do studies with fairly large populations... and to do them
well. Your experience with your zombie-looking vegan neighbour and y our fat
meathead friend don&#39;t prove anything.</p>
<p>To give an example how studies can go astray, let&#39;s talk about red meat. Red
meat gets a bad rap as a cause of cancer and heart diseases, but no studies has
ever found that red meat <em>causes</em> those. Instead, quite a few studies have found
that high red meat consumption is <em>correlated</em> with these issues (and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation">correlation does not imply causation</a>).</p>
<p>This is still pretty bad... excepted if the study fail to control relevant
variables. The first that they should look for is bodyfat percentage. If you eat
more meat but you also eat more of everything, yes, your health outcomes are
going to look much gloomier, no surprise. Maybe it means you eat less vegetables
and your gut flora suffers, also an issue. Unfortunately, poor control of
confounders is the norm.</p>
<h2 id="an-outrageous-guideline">An Outrageous Guideline</h2>
<p>Something interesting occurred recently (November 2019). The prestigious &quot;Annals
of Internal Medicine&quot; journal published some <a href="https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2752328/unprocessed-red-meat-processed-meat-consumption-dietary-guideline-recommendations-from">dietary guidelines</a> for red meat
consumption:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The panel suggests that adults continue current unprocessed red meat
consumption (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence). Similarly, the
panel suggests adults continue current processed meat consumption (weak
recommendation, low-certainty evidence).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The panel&#39;s recommendation was based on 5 meta-reviews (more properly
&quot;systematic review and meta-analysis&quot;). Three of those (<a href="https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2752320/red-processed-meat-consumption-risk-all-cause-mortality-cardiometabolic-outcomes">1</a>, <a href="https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2752321/reduction-red-processed-meat-intake-cancer-mortality-incidence-systematic-review">2</a>,
<a href="https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2752327/patterns-red-processed-meat-consumption-risk-cardiometabolic-cancer-outcomes-systematic">3</a>) looked at &quot;observational studies&quot; which study meat consumption in the
context of people&#39;s existing habits. These tend to be highly-confounded, for the
reasons I explained above. In, in fact, the studies were found to be confounded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limitation: Inadequate adjustment for known confounders, residual confounding
due to observational design, and recall bias associated with dietary
measurement.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>Limitations: Limited causal inferences due to residual confounding in observational
studies, risk of bias due to limitations in diet assessment and adjustment for
confounders, recall bias in dietary assessment, and insufficient data for
planned subgroup analyses</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>Limitations: Observational studies are prone to residual confounding, and
these studies provide low- or very-low-certainty evidence according to the
GRADE criteria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2752323/health-related-values-preferences-regarding-meat-consumption-mixed-methods-systematic">fourth review</a> just considered people&#39;s preference and concludes they
really like meat, even when faced with potential health consequences.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2752326/effect-lower-versus-higher-red-meat-intake-cardiometabolic-cancer-outcomes">fifth meta-review</a> (<a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/longevity/2019-zeraatkar.pdf">pdf</a>) is more interesting, as it reviews
<em>randomized</em> trials. Instead of observing people&#39;s existing diet, diets are
assigned to people randomly, which reduces confounding with other factors. But
unfortunately, there are very few studies who did this over a long period of
time (which is necessary to assess health outcomes), for ethical reasons. The
conclusion ends being up based on a single study, which found no adverse health
outcomes. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not a low-red-meat study, but a low-fat-diet study
in which the low-fat group ended up consuming less red meat than the control
group: on average 1.4 less &quot;servings&quot; per week, which is not huge.</p>
<h2 id="from-ignorance-to-knowledge">From Ignorance to Knowledge</h2>
<p>All this may sound silly — do we actually know anything?</p>
<p>Well, yes we do! What this tells us is that there is no blatant evidence (or not
even <em>much</em> evidence) for the hypothesis that red meat increases mortality.</p>
<p>From the data we have (and the goal of these studies is to be relatively
comprehensive, including all studies whose data can be exploited which are not
methodologically hopeless), we know that:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is highly unlikely that eating more red meat decreases mortality.</li>
<li>It is unlikely that eating less red meat increases mortality.</li>
<li>It is highly unlikely that eating more red meat <em>significantly</em> increases
mortality.</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) is already consensus. As for (2), it is certainly <em>possible</em> that red meat
increases mortality (though (1) is <em>possible</em> too) but if that were the case,
we&#39;d expect to see much stronger evidence. Regarding (3), even if there is an
increase in mortality, it is unlikely to be high.</p>
<p>To distinguish (2) and (3), let&#39;s think about them in another way. The paucity
of evidence that we see means that either red meat doesn&#39;t increase mortality at
all (2), or that it does increase mortality, but ever so slightly so that it&#39;s
hard to distinguish the mortality of red-meat-eaters compared to that of
non-red-meat-eaters.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to note that we learned something: we went from a state of not
having evidence to a state of having evidence, with the evidence favoring the
null hypothesis: that red meat consumption matters very little.</p>
<p>If you draw a line representing a continuum of hypotheses, from -100 = &quot;red meat
consumption decreases mortality&quot; to 0 = &quot;red meat consumption doesn&#39;t change
morality&quot; to 100 = &quot;red meat consumption increases mortality, the evidence we
have puts us at around 1.</p>

<h2 id="controversy-and-the-shills">Controversy and The Shills</h2>
<p>The good people at the Harvard School of Public Health weren&#39;t too happy with
the Annals of Internal Medicine&#39;s guidelines, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2019/09/30/flawed-guidelines-red-processed-meat/">this article</a>.</p>
<p>I should probably warn you, I&#39;m going to say bad things about the good people of
the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
<p>In my opinion, their most egregious statement is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The publication of these studies and the meat guidelines in a major medical
journal is unfortunate because following the new guidelines may potentially
harm individuals’ health, public health, and planetary health. It may also
harm the credibility of nutrition science and erode public trust in scientific
research. In addition, it may lead to further misuse of systematic reviews and
meta-analyses, which could ultimately result in further confusion among the
general public and health professionals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should the (pretty short) article yourself. Essentially it tries to convince
you that these guidelines are <em>a bad thing</em>.</p>
<p>One of their better argument is that the recommendations are bad because it says
environmental considerations are out of scope. That is a whole other can of
worm, and I personally don&#39;t have an opinion on what the environmental impact of
meat production is. This also veers political. But personally, I&#39;m not very
interested in the recommendation but rather in the question: &quot;Is red meat bad
for your health?&quot;.</p>
<p>It&#39;s here that Harvard sins, because they try to say that it is bad for your
health. In the Q&amp;A section of the article, they give a mostly accurate and fair
criticism of the meta-reviews. But then they try to spin this by saying that the
meta-reviews show that red meat consumption is bad for you. Except, as we
already said, it shows very very weak evidence of that.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s update our graph from before:</p>
<pre><code>                 👇 evidence points here
-100 ---------- 0 ---------- 100

                       👆
                    where Harvard SPH says the evidence points
</code></pre>
<p>And that&#39;s why they&#39;re being disingenuous.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s also plug <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gwern/comments/dbw577/effect_of_lower_versus_higher_red_meat_intake_on/f266lfq/">the reaction of Gwern Branwern</a> on that article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t see any problem with the Noble Lie? &#39;They should not publish these
results showing our nutrition research is bullshit, because it may justifiably
erode public trust to know that nutrition research is bullshit, and it might
spark further research which would lead to &quot;further confusion&quot; as the bullshit
is further exposed; we don&#39;t think there is any downside to lying to the
public about meat consumption, damaging lifestyles and ignore the possibility
that our own mistaken results are themselves damaging public health but will
pretend it&#39;s a one-sided wager - &quot;heads we win tails meat loses&quot;.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, remember I spoke about people whose scientific judgement you trust?
Gwern is someone like that, he has great in-depth research up <a href="https://www.gwern.net/">on his
website</a>.</p>
<p>Is Harvard really anti-meat? Well...</p>
<h2 id="tmao--the-red-scare">TMAO &amp; The Red Scare</h2>
<p>Harvard is a big entity, which is probably not anti-meat as a whole.</p>
<p>That being said, Harvard Medical School did publish <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/red-meat-tmao-and-your-heart">this online article</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A substance called trimethylamine N-oxide, which is produced when your body
digests red meat, may raise the risk of cardiovascular problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally! A causal link from red meat to harm. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Well they only reference (and not even link) is to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2734678">a paywalled editorial</a>, but
there is actually <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/40/7/583/5232723">pretty solid research</a> linking red meat with high TMAO. Case
solved?</p>
<p>Well no, because the link between TMAO and cardiovascular problems is shaky, see
for instance <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043276016301448">this paper</a> and this <a href="https://lesslikely.com/nutrition/tmao-mendelian-randomization/">quite nicely written
article</a> titled &quot;How TMAO Fooled Us&quot;.</p>
<p>Apparently, fish increases TMAO even more than red meat, but everyone knows that
fish is healhty! Some people really aren&#39;t bothered by apparent contradictions.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well that&#39;s it for today. I hope this was entertaining/interesting.</p>
