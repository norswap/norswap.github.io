<p>Part of the <a href="/reviews">Reviews Series</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="solo-leveling">Solo Leveling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Webtoon</li>
<li>Volume 1+, up to chapter 131</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/reviews-9/solo-leveling.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Another webtoon, somewhat similar <a href="/reviews-8/#skeleton-soldier-couldnt-defend-the-dungeon-up-to-chapter-109">Skeleton Soldier</a>, albeit more popular (given
it&#39;s the only webtoon anyone&#39;s ever told me about besides the even more popular
<a href="/reviews-8/#tower-of-god-webtoon---up-to-episode-485">Tower of God</a>).</p>
<p>In this universe there are &quot;gates&quot; that appear regularly, which lead to dungeons
full of monsters. These dungeons must be cleared under a certain number of days,
lest the monsters pour out in the real world. However, at the same time these
gates appeared, some people started developing powers, basically turning them
into RPG characters with superior physical abilities and/or magical powers.</p>
<p>The main character is not very strong, but through the vicissitudes of
<del>narrative facility</del> fate, he gets to power up pretty quickly (I&#39;m sure you were
able to guess that from the title).</p>
<p>The story is a massive power trip, but somehow it works.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&#39;t really know why, but I&#39;m a bit of a fan of the aesthetics and
the genre (just like Isekai). I guess I wasted too much time grinding in
World of Warcraft and now my brain is permanently damaged. Expect to see many
more review of <strong>very</strong> similar anime (as it turns out, there are a ton).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know whether to recommend it, I obviously enjoyed it very much, but at
the same time I have no specific glowing praise for it. It&#39;s not clever in any
particularly unique way. Give it a few chapters and drop it if it doesn&#39;t speak
to you!</p>
<p>Somewhat more interestingly, I think this webtoon doesn&#39;t compare super
favorably to <a href="/reviews-8/#skeleton-soldier-couldnt-defend-the-dungeon-up-to-chapter-109">Skeleton Soldier</a>. The fact that the main character can die
(albeit temporarily) in Skeleton Soldier does tend to make the stakes higher.
The story is also more involved, with characters coming in and out of the story.
In general, I&#39;m also intrigued in Skeleton&#39;s universe. The mystery in Solo
Leveling is rather singular for my taste.</p>
<h2 id="jujutsu-kaisen">Jujutsu Kaisen</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anime</li>
</ul>
<p>I watched 5 episodes of this, but it just didn&#39;t click for me. It&#39;s a very
generic shonen that punches under its weight.</p>
<p>Being generic is not a death sentence. Nobody will accuse <a href="/reviews-6/#my-hero-academia-season-4">My Hero Academia</a> of
being incredibly original, yet it&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread.</p>
<p>Jujutsu Kaisen completely failed to pull me into its universe. I found the
moments of tension completely unbelievable. For instance, at some point early in
the series, the main character loses a hand, and I didn&#39;t believe it for even a
second. A bit later in the same episode, something even more egregious happens,
and same thing, didn&#39;t believe it one bit. It&#39;s not like there are amazing
fights, or really interesting character designs / personalities either.</p>
<p>Again, the contrast with Hero Academia is stark: some of the key fights in the
anime so far really got me invested.</p>
<p>I did like the ending theme however, it&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6riDJMI-Y8U">quite funky</a>.</p>
<h2 id="zenkyou-no-terror-terror-in-resonance">Zenkyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anime</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/reviews-9/zenkyou-no-terror.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This has been on my list for quite a while, and I&#39;m happy I finally got around
to watching it.</p>
<p>The story follows two teenagers committing various acts of terrorism in Tokyo.
The big question: what&#39;s their purpose?</p>
<p>I think it works on two plans. First, it&#39;s a &quot;planned crime&quot; show. Early Death
Note comes to mind (sorry, I&#39;m lacking better references here).</p>
<p>Second there is the mystery of purpose. You can kind of infer it as the story
unfolds, but I still found it very interesting.</p>
<p>I&#39;d classify alongside <a href="/reviews-4/#parasyte">Parasyte</a> and <a href="/reviews-7/#erased-boku-dake-ga-inai-machi">Erased</a> in the list of seinens that are
worth your time.</p>
<p>The show is short (only 11 episodes). This is good, as no time is wasted. But on
the other hand, some aspects feel neglected. In particular the character of Lisa
Mishima, a girl that finds herself entangled with the terrorists, lacks in
depth. I understand why she&#39;s in the story, but it feels like a bit more
attention could have made her into more than simply a plot device.</p>
<h2 id="a-returners-magic-should-be-special">A Returner&#39;s Magic Should Be Special</h2>
<ul>
<li>Webtoon</li>
<li>Season 1-2, up to chapter 124</li>
</ul>
<p>And here we are again, with a webtoon that has an RPG-like setting.</p>
<p>The setting is surprisingly similar to <a href="/reviews-9/#solo-leveling">Solo Leveling</a>: dungeons appear in the
world. If they are not cleared, they absorb the surrounding land in some kind of
void. Clearing the dungeons is not just about killing monsters, but also
fulfilling various quests.</p>
<p>This time, the main character is part of an elite group that defeated the final
boss of the worst dungeon to ever appear - only to be killed by the blowback.
Consequently, he wakes up a student in an academy for dungeon-fighters, 10 years
before the appearance of the disastrous dungeon.</p>
<p>Besides the quests inside the dungeons, the RPG element is toned out here: there
is no XP and attributes here, only good old training.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a political dimension as the hero tries to fix what&#39;s wrong with
the continent (namely literal class warfare) to unite people against the coming
threat. Enjoyable, but a bit too much on the nose for my taste.</p>
<p>Just like before: I&#39;m susceptible to this genre, and I liked it.</p>
<h2 id="barakamon">Barakamon</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anime</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/reviews-9/barakamon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another anime recommended by my girlfriend Sasha, and another very pleasant
surprise.</p>
<p>This one is about a professional calligrapher in lack of inspiration and
professional turmoil. His father ships him out a tiny island to shore up his
inspiration.</p>
<p>There he befriends the local townspeople and in particularly the kids. He falls
for the pastoral charm of the country life and learns from the folksy wisdom of
the people. etc. etc. The pitch is not very original — but it works.</p>
<p>In addition to the cute story, the show is pretty hilarious. It&#39;s honestly one
of the funniest showsI&#39;ve seen so far. Probably in my top 2, up there with
<a href="/reviews-8/#kaguya-sama-love-is-war-season-2">Love is War</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also a short one (12 episodes), so don&#39;t hold back.</p>
<h2 id="gateless">Gateless</h2>
<ul>
<li>Book, by Sebastian Marshall &amp; Kai Zau</li>
</ul>
<p>Sebastian Marshall is a &quot;productivity expert&quot;. That sounds pretty corny, but I
don&#39;t know how else to describe him. It might be better to say he&#39;s someone
obsessed with peak performance, who built a <a href="https://www.ultraworking.com/">whole business</a> around that
obsession.</p>
<p>He&#39;s also one I respect immensely, despite not always agreeing with him. That
doesn&#39;t preclude me from mining for useful insights, of which there are many.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been following Sebastian for a while, in particular <a href="http://www.thestrategicreview.net/">The Strategic Review</a>
(I&#39;ve posted <a href="https://norswap.com/celerity/">a summary of one of the series</a> back in 2017), his
<a href="https://www.ultraworking.com/podcast">podcast</a>, and <a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/">his blog</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also not the first book by Sebastian I&#39;m reading. Besides <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23642948-gateless">Gateless</a> - I&#39;ve
previously read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25535056-roguelike">Roguelike</a> which extracts lessons and analogies from classical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelikes</a> with application towards real-life endeavours. (I guess you&#39;d see
how that would talk to me!)</p>
<p>Note that Gateless was co-authored by Sebastian&#39;s co-founder and friend Kai Zau.
Unfortunately, I have much fewer interesting things to tell you about Kai.</p>
<p>So, about this book himself. Well, I didn&#39;t learn much. But that&#39;s also because
I&#39;m well acquainted with Sebastian&#39;s idea, as I think I&#39;ve established.</p>
<p>The book is basically a manual in how to improve in your endeavours. It&#39;s
probably most directly useful if that endeavour is something that resembles &quot;a
career&quot;, but it is general enough to be useful in other areas too.</p>
<p>The book is short enough, but I worry that if you&#39;re at the level where most of
these basics are news to you, then it might actually be a bit much to take in.
It&#39;s also not the funniest read, and it&#39;s notably less fun to read than most of
the Marshall stuff I&#39;ve read before.</p>
<p>So, recommended if you&#39;re a dutiful person looking to fill the gaps in your
strategy. But I&#39;d advise to start with the Marshall productions linked in this
summary.</p>
<p>Finally, I find myself concurring with this (4/5 stars!)
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1377037687">review</a> from GoodReads, which will also give you a bit more
details about the book itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A collection of blog-like essays on thinking about and developing personal
(&quot;Capacity&quot; and &quot;Meaning&quot; sections), social (&quot;Signal&quot; and &quot;Network&quot;) and
financial capital (&quot;Assets&quot;).</p>
<p>There is nothing terribly new here and large chunks of the book are verbatim
quotes taken from other sources. Meaning and Assets sections are largely
cursory.</p>
<p>Despite this, I quite enjoyed it - though nothing particularly new, their
particular formulation of the ideas resonated with me.</p>
<p>Generally, recommendable - especially for fresh graduates just entering the
world.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tactical-barbell">Tactical Barbell</h2>
<ul>
<li>Book</li>
</ul>
<p>And now for something completely different, a book about weightlifting.</p>
<p>I must say this one disappointed me. First, because I heard the Tactical Barbell
approach integrated conditioning (i.e. cardio &amp; high intensity endurance work),
but it turns out that part is outlined in the second book.</p>
<p>Second, because the book says very little about lifting, and does so in too many
words.</p>
<p>The core approach is to train only big compound lifts (squat, bench press,
deadlift, pullups, ...) at submaximal intensities (i.e. maybe a <a href="/weight-training-5/#reactive-training-systems-rts">7-8 RPE</a>)
with plenty of rest (up to 5 minutes) between sets.</p>
<p>That&#39;s pretty boring, though I have no doubts that it works, at least up to a
certain point (but far enough for most people, including me currently).</p>
<p>An important point is that the book is targeted to an &quot;operational&quot; audience:
police, army, SWAT, firefighters, ... (hence the &quot;tactical&quot; in the title). A big
point is that these people may already have some fairly intense physical
workloads (in the course of work, or because of work-mandated training), so the
strength work should be as efficient as possible and not leave them too tired to
perform well.</p>
<p>That being said, the book goes so much out of its way to evoke out this
&quot;operational&quot; image that it had me wonder if it wasn&#39;t <em>really</em> marketed at
people who have a tactical fetish.</p>
<p>A few parts of the book also inspire distrust. The author claims to have reached
4% body fat at some point, for instance. The section on supplements is as best a
N=1 field report, and contains no actual scientific facts.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll see if book 2 is better!</p>
<h2 id="tactical-barbell-2-conditioning">Tactical Barbell 2: Conditioning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Book</li>
</ul>
<p>I liked the second book much better. One reason is that it actually contained
things I wasn&#39;t really much informed about. It also contains an actionable plan
(a program, really). It&#39;s easy to find good quality strength programs online
(e.g. <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/">one</a>, <a href="https://builtwithscience.com/best-full-body-workout/">two</a>), but I haven&#39;t stumbled on a program aiming to
develop and maintain conditioning before.</p>
<p>The book is also better organized, with the principles outlined in the first
part (+ still quite a bit of fluff) and the extensive exercise plan in the
second part.</p>
<p>Ultimately, reviewing the book is not that useful — I ought to try this and
review the program. I&#39;m thinking I might do the &quot;base-building&quot; 8-week block
after I redo a strength block when the gym re-opens.</p>
<h2 id="from-dusk-till-dawn">From Dusk Till Dawn</h2>
<ul>
<li>Movie</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/reviews-9/from-dusk-till-dawn.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This was the last &quot;Tarantino movie&quot; that I hadn&#39;t seen. It isn&#39;t <em>really</em> a
Tarantino movie, as Tarantino only wrote the script (and plays a major acting
role in the movie), but the movie was directed by Robert Rodriguez.</p>
<p>The flick is fast-paced and pretty fun. At first glance, it looks like it&#39;s
going to be classical rough-n-dirty Tarantino flick, but the genre of this movie
is actually action horror.</p>
<p>And so things take a turn for the weird at some point. And it&#39;s great.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a bit hard to say if it&#39;s a B-movie or an homage to B-movies. It&#39;s
certainly a bit of parody, albeit of nothing in particular.</p>
<p>A good time that happens to involve a lot of gore.</p>
<h2 id="gone-girl">Gone Girl</h2>
<ul>
<li>Movie</li>
</ul>
<p>This movie is tricky to describe. Wikipedia says it&#39;s a &quot;psychological thriller&quot;
and I think that does fit the bill. To me, it&#39;s one of those &quot;guess movies&quot;,
where I can&#39;t prevent myself from annoying the hell of whoever I&#39;m watching it
with (in this case, Sasha) by interjecting all my hypothesis about what the hell
could be going on.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the pitch: writer Nick Dunne finds his wife missing and contacts the
police. A search is organized, and troublesome truths about the relationship
come to light.</p>
<p>That does sound a bit dull, but there is a mystery, and the twist and turns are
quite satisfying. This movie will have you wondering.</p>
<p>There&#39;s only really one thing I disliked about it: the very ending. Not that I
objected to it, I just thought it was poorly justified and didn&#39;t make a lot of
sense.</p>
<p>In making this review, I realized that (a) this is a David Fincher, and (b) I&#39;ve
actually consumed most of Fincher&#39;s cinematographic output: Seven, The Game,
Fight Club, Benjamin Button, The Social Network, The Girl With The Dragon
Tattoo, Zodiac, and now Gone Girl - as well as House of Cards. Most of those are
pretty good. If you haven&#39;t seen them, I&#39;d particularly recommend Gone Girl, The
Game, Fight Club, and the first season of House of Cards.</p>
<h2 id="zero-to-one">Zero to One</h2>
<ul>
<li>Book</li>
</ul>
<p>The book outlines Peter Thiel&#39;s (a founder of PayPal and Palantir) business
philosophy - especially regarding startups.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s well worth reading for anyone interested in eventually starting a
business (especially an ambitious one), or just interesting in business in
general.</p>
<p>To give you an idea, here&#39;s my very short summary of a few ideas I took away
from the book.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Startups should aim to become monopolies — because a monopoly is not
constantly under threat and thus has the space to innovate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>One of the ways to establish a monopoly is networks effects. And paradoxically,
network effect monopolies must get started with a small market — one that the
startup can completely corner. For instance, Facebook started serving only
Harvard students.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A startup&#39;s most important asset is new thinking. A startup needs &quot;a secret&quot; —
something it believes to be true, while the consensus (not just the majority)
thinks that it is false. What valuable company is no one else building?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sales &amp; distribution matter more than they&#39;re made out to in the startup
world.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sales is always hidden. &quot;Salesman&quot; is nobody&#39;s title, instead it might be
&quot;customer happiness office&quot; for a very transparent example. You don&#39;t know
any sales grandmaster - because you don&#39;t think of them as such.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Computers will not replace humans - the future is complementarity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solo-bug-leveling">Solo Bug Leveling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Webtoon</li>
<li>Season 1, up to chapter 40</li>
</ul>
<p>Veteran MMO player dies, gets reincarnated in the game. Can&#39;t be more classic
than that.</p>
<p>Here though, the hero gets reincarnated as an (adult) lord of some small
province. Armed with his encyclopedic knowledge of the game (and, as the title
implies, of its bugs), he sets out to make right everything that is wrong, and
to prepare adequately for future turmoil.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure I have too much to say about this one. The setting and the
execution are both solid. An enjoyable read.</p>
<h2 id="slave-b">Slave B</h2>
<ul>
<li>Webtoon</li>
<li>Season 1, up to chapter 50</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/reviews-9/slave-b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So this one departs <em>a little bit</em> from the leveling webtoons I&#39;ve been reading,
but it&#39;s not too far away.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the story of slave kid who, after some mishap, finds the opportunity to
attend a prestigious caster/fighter military academy.</p>
<p>The focus is not too much on leveling or skill acquisition (although there is a
bit of that), but more on inter-personal relationships and in particular the
ostracism towards the slaves. In that it&#39;s a bit similar to <a href="/reviews-9/#a-returner-s-magic-should-be-special-webtoon">Returner</a> and its
commoner/noble distinction — except way worse.</p>
<p>This one is also different in that it&#39;s not a clean nice power trip drive. The
hero does experience quite a few setbacks, and a lot of suffering. The story is
also interested in dealing with the resulting anger (instead of featuring a
noble hero that would brush it off instantly).</p>
<p>I&#39;d say this story has more ambition than what I&#39;d read so far. Or if not that,
at least it takes more risk by dealing with emotions and more complex
relationship dynamics. It&#39;s not quite as masterful as some of these others (like
Skeleton or Solo Leveling), perhaps precisely because of these dimensions.</p>
<p>But all in all, quite interesting, and might appeal to a more mainstream
audience that doesn&#39;t have some kind of leveling fetish.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning-after-the-end">The Beginning After The End</h2>
<ul>
<li>Webtoon</li>
<li>Season 1-3, up to chapter 85</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet another webtoon in the same vein.</p>
<p>In this one, our hero is nothing less than a conqueror king, reincarnated. His
original lifetime seemingly had magic but also a futuristic setting, while his
reincarnated life happens in a more medieval type of settings, complete with
elves and dwarves.</p>
<p>I felt like this webtoon did itself a service by taking some breathing room.
Over 85 chapters, the plot advances much less than some other webtoons in the
same genre. Amusingly, we see the reincarnated hero age from 0 to 13 years old -
and he is just now about to join some kind of magic school.</p>
<p>This space is mostly potentiality - it means the webtoon does not commit faults
by rushing the plot and the relationships between the characters, but it also
means that the number of plot points has been limited so far. If done correctly
though, the greater familiarity we have acquired with the characters will lead
to a much more satisfying punch down the line, and the character development
will feel meaningful. We can only hope.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to say that nothing happened, and it&#39;s been a very enjoyable read so
far, it&#39;s not exactly a tapestry of intrigue, but I have nothing critical to say
about it either.</p>
<p>Just like <a href="/reviews-9/#slave-b-webtoon-up-to-chapter-50">Slave B</a>, this one is also much less leveling oriented (though the
theme is present as skill acquisition and mana mastery).</p>
<p>Interestingly, I got a very <em>cozy</em> vibe from this toon. The hero&#39;s original (and
still mysterious) life was lonely, as an orphan that somehow made it to the top.
The webtoon emphasizes, on the other hand, how precious his family and friends
are to him in his new life. And you know what, I&#39;m all for that.</p>
<p>All in all, very recommended.</p>
<h2 id="the-mandalorian-season-2">The Mandalorian Season 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>TV</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously: <a href="/reviews-5/#the-mandalorian">Season 1</a></p>
<p>The second season does not disappoint — it&#39;s still great. It does tell us more
about the character of the show, however. Sasha sent me this comic:</p>
<p><img src="/reviews-9/mandalorian.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And so it is - it&#39;s an episodic show. The second season doesn&#39;t launch in grand
intrigues any more than the first one does. With only 8 episodes and a flair for
showing great action sequences, maybe that&#39;s preferable (the counterexample
here would be John Wick - great first movie, terrible franchise).</p>
<p>I did get a bit frustrated by the 6th episode, however. There were too many
frustrations of the type where I go like &quot;why didn&#39;t you do this? you literally
did it 5 minutes ago! but now it&#39;s useful!&quot; and &quot;of course that&#39;s precisely the
moment where X would happen!!&quot;. Probably this is actually a weakness of the show
and this happens more than I realize — I&#39;m typically an easy audience. But in
that episode, it was really hard to overlook. Fortunately, the show made up for
it with an excellent 7th episode and an adequate, if
not-quite-as-good-as-first-season&#39;s, finale.</p>
<p>Disney is apparently very intent on milking the Star Wars cow, and in particular
the Mandalorian cow (probably especially so after they drove the main series
into the ground). Next year we can expect, in addition to season 3, a show on
Bobba Fett. But there&#39;s more! Disney is working on two more Mandalorian spinoffs,
one on Jedi <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano">Ahsoka Tano</a> (from the animated movies and appearing in this season
of Mando), one on the New Republic Rangers. And there&#39;s also one on Lando
Calrissian. I expect a mixed bag, but let&#39;s hope for one or two gems in there.
This is the way.</p>
