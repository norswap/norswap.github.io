</ul>
<hr>
<p>I got so much enjoyment out of <a href="/hell-yeah">&quot;Hell Yeah Or No&quot;</a> that I decided to
read Derek Sivers&#39; other book &quot;Your Music and Your People&quot;.</p>
<p>At first glance, the book isn&#39;t really for me: it&#39;s a treatise on how to market
yourself in the music business. However it&#39;s written in this terse and
delightfully-to-the-point Sivers style. And really, most of the lessons
generalize to any kind of marketing, which we all need from time to time.</p>
<p>Boxing this into &quot;marketing&quot; also doesn&#39;t seem to cut it. Some of the lessons
are much more broadly applicable.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t really thought much about marketing before, but I
excerpted a lot of this one. Just like last time, titles are chapter titles, and
what follows are quotes (mostly) and paraphrases from that chapter. Sometimes
the chapter title is enough!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="business-is-creative">Business is creative</h2>
<p>But turning off your creativity—trying to play it safe—is the worst thing you
could do. Just like with music.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-only-a-test-see-what-happens">This is only a test. See what happens</h2>
<p>It’s actually impossible to fail if your only mission was to see what happens!</p>
<h2 id="restrictions-will-set-you-free">Restrictions will set you free</h2>
<h2 id="make-mystery--make-people-wonder">Make mystery : make people wonder</h2>
<p>Don’t be so plain or obvious that there’s nothing left to wonder. But don’t be
so cryptic that they give up.</p>
<p>Once people start wondering, they can’t stand not knowing.</p>
<h2 id="marketing-just-means-being-considerate">&quot;Marketing&quot; just means being considerate</h2>
<p>Marketing means listening for what people need, and creating something
surprisingly tailored for them.</p>
<p>Marketing means getting to know people, making a deeper connection, and keeping
in touch.</p>
<h2 id="constantly-ask-what-they-really-want">Constantly ask what they really want</h2>
<h2 id="touch-as-many-of-their-senses-as-you-can">Touch as many of their senses as you can</h2>
<p>The more senses you touch in someone, the more they’ll remember you.</p>
<h2 id="life-is-like-high-school">Life is like high school</h2>
<p>You can approach this strategically, as if you were a new kid going to a new
school, with a goal to be popular. It sounds shallow, but it works.</p>
<p>Be who they want to be. In your role as a musician, it’s actually considerate!</p>
<p>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal boring
world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had the courage.</p>
<h2 id="get-personal">Get personal</h2>
<p>People send business to people they like.</p>
<p>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a friend.
That’s how things are done.</p>
<h2 id="always-think-how-you-can-help-someone">Always think how you can help someone</h2>
<p>Ask them what’s the hardest part about their job.</p>
<h2 id="dont-be-afraid-to-ask-for-favors">Don’t be afraid to ask for favors</h2>
<p>People like doing favors!</p>
<p>By making them feel important, connected, and needed, you’ll be doing them a
favor, too.</p>
<h2 id="small-gifts-go-a-long-way">Small gifts go a long way</h2>
<p>Get presents for the people you’ve met that are probably under-appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="persistence-is-polite">Persistence is polite</h2>
<p>But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying, you’re a
loser!</p>
<p>If someone doesn’t get back to you, it probably wasn’t intentional. Everyone is
busy, and their situation has nothing to do with you.</p>
<h2 id="repeatedly-follow-up-to-show-you-care">Repeatedly follow-up to show you care</h2>
<h2 id="pedestals-prevent-friendships">Pedestals prevent friendships</h2>
<h2 id="how-to-get-through-the-gates">How to get through the gates?</h2>
<p>Get someone with access to the inside to promote you.</p>
<h2 id="have-someone-work-the-inside-of-the-industry">Have someone work the inside of the industry</h2>
<h2 id="get-specific">Get specific!</h2>
<h2 id="call-the-destination-and-ask-for-directions">Call the destination, and ask for directions</h2>
<p>We know where we want to be, but we don’t know how to get there.</p>
<p>Work backwards. Just contact someone who’s there, and ask how to get there.</p>
<h2 id="flip-it-in-your-favor">Flip it in your favor</h2>
<p>The old saying, &quot;It’s all who you know,&quot; used to feel so defeating.</p>
<p>[after he bought pizza for a hungry music exec visiting school] For the next two
years, he took my calls and gave me all kinds of advice about the music
business.</p>
<p>Everything that seems depressing can beﬂipped to work in my favor.</p>
<p>Every deal that’s bad for someone is good for someone else. So instead of
moaning about the bad side, you can take the good side.</p>
<h2 id="a-curious-answer-to-the-most-common-question">A curious answer to the most common question</h2>
<p>[&quot;What kind of music do you do?&quot; - but works for other questions too]</p>
<p>With one interesting phrase to describe your music, you can make total strangers
wonder about you.</p>
<h2 id="make-people-curious-in-one-sentence">Make people curious in one sentence.</h2>
<h2 id="without-a-good-reason-they-wont-bother">Without a good reason, they won’t bother</h2>
<p>(checking your music, business, ...)</p>
<p>When they ask what kind of music you do, they’re actively hoping you’ll give
them a reason to care.</p>
<p>If you don’t give them a reason in that very moment, the opportunity is gone.</p>
<h2 id="dont-know-how-to-describe-your-music">Don’t know how to describe your music?</h2>
<p>Ask people how they would describe. Look at the description / reviews of other
music.</p>
<p>When you’ve got one you like, try it out on people. See if their face lights up.
See if they get curious.</p>
<h2 id="use-the-tricks-that-worked-on-you">Use the tricks that worked on you</h2>
<p>Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your attention.</p>
<h2 id="proudly-exclude-most-people">Proudly exclude most people</h2>
<p>Loudly reject 99%. It signals who you are. When someone in your target 1% hears
you proudly excluding the rest, they’ll be drawn to you.</p>
<h2 id="well-rounded-doesnt-cut">Well-rounded doesn’t cut</h2>
<p>Only problem is, if you’re well-rounded, you can’t cut through anything. You
need to be sharply deﬁned, like a knife.</p>
<p>Look at the long careers of David Bowie, Miles Davis, Madonna, Prince, Joni
Mitchell, or Paul Simon. Each went through sharply-deﬁned phases, treating each
album as a project with a narrow focus.</p>
<p>Do this every year or two, and you will have a wide variety in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="doing-the-opposite-of-everyone-is-valuable">Doing the opposite of everyone is valuable</h2>
<p>It’s supply and demand. The more people do something, the less valuable it is.</p>
<p>Everyone else is multi-tasking. So it’s more valuable to single-task.
Everyone else is hyper-connected. So it’s more valuable to disconnect.</p>
<p>Don’t try to beat them at their game. Play a completely different game. Be
radically opposite. Don’t be associated with them in any way. Be so different
that people don’t even think to compare you.</p>
<h2 id="selling-music-by-solving-a-speciﬁc-need">Selling music by solving a speciﬁc need</h2>
<h2 id="people-search-harder-for-the-obscure">People search harder for the obscure</h2>
<p>Fans of the obscure niches search harder for it. Make sure they canﬁnd you. You
want the passionate fans of your niche, not the casual fans of mainstream.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-a-database">Why you need a database</h2>
<p>(for tracking people)</p>
<h2 id="stay-in-touch-with-hundreds-of-people">Stay in touch with hundreds of people</h2>
<p>[This chapter include a short description of a system for keeping in touch with people.]</p>
<p>Most people are so bad at keeping in touch that they will really appreciate you
doing it.</p>
<h2 id="meet-three-new-people-every-week">Meet three new people every week</h2>
<p>If we assume your music is great, and you are a likeable person that people
enjoy helping, I’ll make this prediction: The number of people you meet will
determine your success.</p>
<h2 id="keep-in-touch">Keep in touch</h2>
<p>The difference between success and failure can be as simple as keeping in touch.</p>
<h2 id="every-breakthrough-comes-from-someone-you-know">Every breakthrough comes from someone you know</h2>
<p>Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with your
existing contacts.</p>
<h2 id="put-your-fans-to-work">Put your fans to work</h2>
<h2 id="include-everyone-in-your-success">Include everyone in your success</h2>
<p>(that helped you get there or treated you well)</p>
<h2 id="how-to-attend-a-conference">How to attend a conference</h2>
<p>Trade contact info within a few minutes of meeting.</p>
<p>Send them a message immediately, connecting the digital you to the physical you.</p>
<p>Before the conference, come up with one interesting sentence that says what you
do—including a curious bit that will make them ask a follow-up question. For
example: “Bassist of the Crunchy Frogs—the worst punk bluegrass band ever. We’re
headlining the showcase tonight. Our singer is a pirate.”</p>
<p>Real business is done in the follow-up, not the conference itself.</p>
<p>The best time to get down to business is when they’re alone, back at their
ofﬁce, a week or two after the conference, and can give you their full
one-on-one attention.</p>
<h2 id="dont-be-a-mosquito">Don’t be a mosquito</h2>
<p>Learn what they love. Learn what they want. Figure out what you can do for them.</p>
<h2 id="valuable-to-others-or-only-you">Valuable to others, or only you?</h2>
<p>But money only comes from doing something valuable to others.</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on making your music more valuable to others.</li>
<li>Stop expecting it to be valuable to others.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="emphasize-meaning-over-price">Emphasize meaning over price</h2>
<p>It changes the request from a commercial pitch to an emotional connection.</p>
<h2 id="some-people-like-to-pay-let-them">Some people like to pay. Let them</h2>
<p>When you’re offering something for free, don’t forget that there are lots of
people that like to pay! Appeal to this side of people, giving them a reason to
pay that feels good.</p>
<h2 id="the-higher-the-price-the-more-they-value-it">The higher the price, the more they value it</h2>
<p>So it’s considerate to charge more for your work. People will appreciate it
more, and get better results.</p>
<h2 id="are-fans-telling-friends-if-not-dont-promote">Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote</h2>
<h2 id="dont-promote-until-people-can-take-action">Don’t promote until people can take action</h2>
<h2 id="move-to-the-big-city">Move to the big city</h2>
<p>Living in the big city, and being where everything is happening, will help your
career the most.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-dreams-blind-you-to-new-means">Detailed dreams blind you to new means</h2>
<h2 id="are-you-at-the-starting-line-or-the-ﬁnish-line">Are you at the starting line or the ﬁnish line?</h2>
<p>For some artists, releasing their music is like the starting line in a race. The
gun goes off! They work it! They spend hours a day pushing, promoting, and
selling—reaching new people by any means necessary.</p>
<h2 id="ignore-advice-that-drains-you">Ignore advice that drains you</h2>
<h2 id="compass-in-your-gut">Compass in your gut</h2>
<p>Whatever excites you, go do it.
Whatever drains you, stop doing it.</p>
<p>But nothing is worth losing your enthusiasm. Nothing!</p>
<p>There’s almost nothing that you must do.</p>
