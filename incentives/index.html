<p>Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the
power of incentives.<br>— <a href="https://norswap.com/munger-psychology/">Charlie Munger</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>During this past month, I had a lot of fun with <a href="https://1729.com">1729.com</a>, a
newsletter that pays its members in Bitcoins for performing tasks — which are
typically interesting and will teach you something useful.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the main things I did so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://1729.com/proof-of-workout/">Worked out</a> (didn&#39;t need them for that,
but it was nice getting 10$ for it!)</li>
<li><a href="https://1729.com/learn-basic-elixir-with-exercism/">Learned some Elixir</a></li>
<li><a href="https://1729.com/decentralized-task-creation/">Wrote a task for the newsletter to
reuse</a> — <a href="https://ghost.norswap.com/paving-the-titans-way/">here&#39;s my
task</a>. The useful thing in
this one was actually to setup <a href="https://www.cloudron.io/">cloudron</a> on <a href="https://www.oracle.com/be/cloud/">the
oracle cloud</a> (not shilling this because I&#39;m
an Oracle employeed, but because I&#39;m cheap and it&#39;s the only one that has a
permanent free tier). Cloudron is a cool service manager that lets you install
a bunch of server apps (including the <a href="https://ghost.org/">ghost</a> blog
platform). Don&#39;t worry, I still like my <a href="https://github.com/norswap/norswap.github.io/tree/master/_factory">homegrown website
generator</a>
better :)</li>
<li><a href="https://1729.com/refer-task-sponsors/">Cold-emailed some rich people to ask for
money</a> — not something I&#39;d normally
feel very comfortable doing.</li>
<li><a href="https://1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country/">Wrote an article expanding on the idea of building a new digital-first
country</a> — <a href="https://ghost.norswap.com/new-country/">here&#39;s my
article</a>. I must admit I feel a bit
shy about this one, because it&#39;s such an optimistic view — which is not really
my usual personality. But that&#39;s also why it was a useful exercise to get into
a different perspective. It did get me thinking about blockchain technologies
and their potential — expect a more nuanced article on that soon.</li>
<li><a href="https://1729.com/quantum-computing-and-proof-of-memory/">Learned about quantum
computing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://1729.com/video-memes-on-indian-crypto/">Made a video meme about India&#39;s crypto
ban</a> — I went for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ecnei9vtLyU">Hitler
reacts</a> classic</li>
</ul>
<p>My submissions got selected on some of these tasks and I got ~220$ out of those
that have been awarded so far. That&#39;s less that I could have earned otherwise in
the same timespan if I was hell-bent on earning money. But as we&#39;ll see below,
that&#39;s not why I did it.</p>
<p>There are now new tasks to learn about crypto technologies (the <a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name
Service</a> and <a href="https://1729.com/learn-solidity-with-cryptozombies/">learning the solidity smart contract
langauge</a>. I&#39;m excited to
do these too.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m actually not writing this to shill 1729. Rather, it&#39;s to marvel about
the power of incentives.</p>
<p>See — most of these things I enjoyed doing and might have done without the
possibility of a monetary compensation. But living is prioritizing (if you&#39;re
doing it right at least) and besides working out, none of these things were
high-priority enough.</p>
<p>But 1729 offered me a collection of incentives to complete the tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>I may earn some money!</li>
<li>There&#39;s a deadline.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve attempted all tasks so far, so I&#39;m strongly motivated to attempt new
tasks, for the sake of completion (gamification!)</li>
<li>These tasks have generally taught me something, or reinforced some good habit
or useful behaviour.</li>
<li>The tasks have been devised to be doable in a reasonable timeframe — no need
to worry about biting off more than one can chew.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, there was a reason that most of these things were not on my todo
list. But the added incentives were enough to put them past the hump. And the
way I use my time is far from optimal. Had I not, say, written an article, I
might have watched an interesting youtube video instead with no relevance to my
daily life. The incentives stir you towards spending your time smarter.</p>
<p>It also got me thinking. If 1729 can incentivize me in this way, can&#39;t I do the
same to me? I can certainly chunk task in manageable bits, and set deadlines. I
can also use <a href="https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy">the seinfeld
method</a> and build
on top of a series of small wins. Paying yourself gets more tricky, however. I
think I know how to make it work.</p>
<p>The key is that I&#39;m cheap. So there are a few not-so-unresonable expenses that I
don&#39;t make because they are not strictly necessary or an improvement to my
day-to-day life. Now say there&#39;s something I want to get done, or a behaviour I
want to promote. If I care enough about that, I can justify paying to speed it
up. On the other end, I get the reward if I complete the task within the
deadline. It&#39;s a smart way to get in alignment with yourself.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a snag though — what if you don&#39;t make the deadline? Do you just put the
reward back in play? As the payer this makes sense — you want the thing done
after all. But on the other end, this is the wrong lesson: you can slip the
deadline but still get the reward (albeit later). I think the key here is to
reward yourself for consistency. So if you slip, the previous reward might be
out of play for the next task, which will grant a smaller (or more generic)
reward. But if you succeed at that one, <em>and</em> at the next one, then you get the
original reward. That way, you get the nice rewards only if you keep succeeding
consistently.</p>
<p>I will try to experiment with these micro-incentive structures in the near
future.</p>
