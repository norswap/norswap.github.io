      <title>Random Generation Testing</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;At its core, testing is the process of building redundancy in order to ward off
errors. When you write usual unit tests, you&amp;#39;re comparing the output of your
code with the output of your brain, given the same inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always found testing profoundly unpleasant. It&amp;#39;s hard to select the proper
inputs to root out all possible issues. One way to look at it is that good
testing should exercise all possible paths through the program. That is of
course impossible — but we could narrow it down to a representative sample,
e.g. where loop repetitions of n &amp;gt; 2 are considered identical. You still get
combinatorial explosion. This is in fact the major limitation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution&quot;&gt;symbolic
execution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test coverage is an even further approximation. Instead of considering paths
through the program, we &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; want to ensure that tests run every piece of code
at least once. That doesn&amp;#39;t give you a whole lot of guarantees. And yet,
reaching a high percentage of test coverage in tests already seems like a really
hard challenge for most software teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides a few obvious edge cases, selecting inputs is hard, because the most
interesting inputs are those we probably wouldn&amp;#39;t pick, reflecting blind spots
in our implementation. I&amp;#39;m a perfectionnist, and just good enough at programming
to realize how bad I really am. The realization that I&amp;#39;m leaving a whole lot
untested always eats at me when I write traditional unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But fear not, for I have the cure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental weakness of testing is that we even have to select the inputs.
We have to select inputs because we&amp;#39;re comparing the program against our brains,
which we of course cannot &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; during a test suite. Instead, results for
pre-selected inputs have to be hardcoded in the test suite. What if we compared
our program to another program instead? If you are re-implementing an existing
system or protocol, then you&amp;#39;re all set! Otherwise, you need to write the second
implementation yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple objections could be raised. The first one: if your test fails, how do
you know which program is at fault? Good one: you don&amp;#39;t. You have the same
problem with brain-computed results though. When you run your test for the first
time, how do you know whether the program or the expected results are wrong?
Usualy, you double check. But it is true this is more of a problem when
comparing two program, because these kinds of test tend to go much much further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another objection: you&amp;#39;re doing the work twice! In theory, yes. In practice, you
can cast by the wayside a whole lot of non-essential requirements in the second
implementation: performance, deployment, durability (writing to a DB),
resiliency (logging, transactions) and probably more, in order to focus on
&amp;quot;business logic&amp;quot;. In fact the second implementation should be as naive and
simple as possible, to minimize the chance you made a mistake there (but do see
the caveat in the next objection). As a side benefit, you might gain some
understanding by writing the second implementation. Finally, consider the time
it would take to write regular tests. For some teams, it&amp;#39;s not rare that it
approaches or exceeds 50% of the total development time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third objection: aren&amp;#39;t you likely to reproduce the same mistakes in both
implementations. That is a danger, yes. Multiple steps can be taken to avoid
this. One is to make the second implementation as simple as possible. Another is
to have two separate people write both implementations (also great to make
hidden assumptions come to light). Yet another is to write the two
implementations in radically different styles: purely functional, logical, using
another architecture (but while keeping it as simple as possible within that
style).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have logic redundancy, you are free from the tyranny of input
selection. You can input anything, the the same result should come out of the
end of both programs. Hence, the next logical step is to randomly generate
this input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the trickiest part of the process: you have to ensure that the
random generation process is able to generate most interesting inputs (our
&lt;em&gt;representative sample&lt;/em&gt; from earlier), and that the combination of probabilities
does not make some of these inputs as likely as the second coming of the
dinosaurs. Of course, the more complex your input, the harder this is. However,
I&amp;#39;m currently applying this method to genreate whole &lt;acronym title=&quot;Abstract
Syntax Trees&quot;&gt;ASTs&lt;/acronym&gt;, so it&amp;#39;s unlikely to ever be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get this right, you can run the tests — which generates inputs forever,
runs both programs and compares their outputs — and get confidence in your
implementation(s) proportional to the running time. Even if you don&amp;#39;t get it
entirely right, you&amp;#39;re unlikely to do worse than hand-selected scenarios, you&amp;#39;ll
just eschew some interesting types of inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invert, always invert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s now look at an interesting variation on that theme. This applies when
there is a one-to-one (or almost one-to-one) mapping between your input and your
output. So you can go from input to output, and then back from output to input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that instead of building a second implementation, you build the
inverse of the implementation (taking outputs to inputs). Then, instead of
generating inputs, you generate outputs, take them back to inputs with the
inverse program, and back again with the actual program, and check that the
final outputs match the generated outputs. It&amp;#39;s also possible to go inputs →
outputs → inputs instead, depending on what makes the most sense. As an added
benefit, the inverse is often useful in its own right, or downright necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied this approach to test &lt;a href=&quot;/reusable-lexer&quot;&gt;the lexer I wrote about recently&lt;/a&gt;, here are
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/core0/tree/cea49b103f86b260df46fee67e01940d1b2a1634/test/core/lexer&quot;&gt;the tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Reusable Lexer</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing a small programming language — codename &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/core0&quot;&gt;Core 0&lt;/a&gt; — in order to try
out multiple ideas I have in language design and compiler implementation (which
is fortunate, as that happens to be my research topic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in that journey was to write a lexer. A lexer (aka tokenizer) is
a system that turns a textual input into a stream of tokens. Typical tokens:
numbers, identifiers, keywords, operators, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While parsing can handle characters directly, going through a lexer has multiple
advantages (which, it should be said, I failed to appreciate in the past).
First, it helps performance by avoiding to match the same token again and again.
Second, it helps error reporting, but supplying a less granular unit of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to design the lexer to be reusable, by which I mean that it shouldn&amp;#39;t
be tied to any specific language. In particular, I wanted to avoid hardwiring a
particular choice of keywords and operators in the lexer. This is not to say the
lexer can handle all languages, far from it. Reuse by copy and modification is
fine for me. In fact, I think much harm has been done by insisting on components
that can be reused in any situation without modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s frequent for lexers to be specified as a set of regular expressions (one
regex per token type) and to assume that the lexer always takes the longest
match at the current position. The implementation is typically not done like
that for performance reasons, but rather it&amp;#39;s structured as a big ole
character-level switch loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have followed the regex approach but I didn&amp;#39;t really see the point, so I
wrote an English &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/core0/blob/master/src/core/lexer/_README.md&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; for the lexer, making each token type mutually
exclusive (so that there is never an ambiguity). That was a useful exercise to
crystallize my thoughts. I also included a series of restrictions on valid token
streams that follow naturally from the tokens definitions. For instance, an
identifer cannot directly follow another identifier, otherwise the lexer would
have generated a single, longer identifier instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting decision I made is that the lexer always generates a stream of
tokens, for every input. To do so, there is a &lt;em&gt;garbage&lt;/em&gt; token type that
encapsulates spans of characters that cannot be attached to a token. Typically,
these are non-ascii characters that are not part of a comment or litteral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation is in Java but it follows a rather weird — almost C-like —
style. The reason is that eventually I want to bootstrap the Core 0 compiler
(write it in itself). Because of that, I want to keep the implementation as
simple and decoupled from Java&amp;#39;s idiosyncracies as possible. I also don&amp;#39;t expect
that Core 0 will be object-oriented. For the same reason, I also didn&amp;#39;t use any
libraries, including the standard libraries. There are a few exceptions, but I
encapsulated them neatly in their own functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/core0/commit/cea49b103f86b260df46fee67e01940d1b2a1634&quot;&gt;the code here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for a description of the testing methodology I use to test the lexer,
and further infos on Core 0&amp;#39;s implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Bed of Procrustes: Chosen Tidbits</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Bed of Procrustes&amp;quot; is a book of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism&quot;&gt;aphorisms&lt;/a&gt; by Nassim Taleb, who
also wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness&quot;&gt;Fooled by Randomness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile&quot;&gt;Antifragile&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;#39;t read those yet,
but I plan to give them a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taleb&amp;#39;s style is witty and biting. This makes his writings entertaining, at the
very least. But whether I agree with him or not, Taleb never fails to make me
think. He truly is an original thinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what caught my eye in &amp;quot;The Bed of Procrustes&amp;quot;. See for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

The test of originality for an idea is not the absence of one single predecessor
but the presence of multiple but incompatible ones.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Your reputation is harmed most by what you say to defend it.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

They will envy you for your success, for your wealth, for your intelligence, for
your looks, for your status — but rarely for your wisdom.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Most of what they call humility is successfully disguised arrogance.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

The characteristic feature of the loser is to bemoan, in general terms,
mankind&amp;#39;s flaws, biases, contradictions, and irrationality — without exploiting
them for fun and profit.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Success is becoming in middle adulthood what you dreamed to be in late
childhood. The rest comes from loss of control.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

It is the appearance of inconsistency, and not its absence, that makes people
attractive.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Wisdom in the young is as unattractive as frivolity in the elderly.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

You exist if and only if you are free to do things without a visible objective,
with no justification and, above all, outside the dictatorship of someone else&amp;#39;s
narrative.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Most feed their obsessions by trying to get rid of them.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Charm is the ability to insult people without offending them; nerdiness the
reverse.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

There are two types of people: those who try to win and those who try to win
arguments. They are never the same.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

People are so prone to overcausation that you can make the reticent turn
loquacious by dropping an occasional &amp;quot;why?&amp;quot; in the conversation.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

We are satisfied with old objects like vistas or classical paintings but
insatiabde with technologies, amplifying small improvements in versions,
obsessed about 2.0, caught in a mental treadmill.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

My only measure of success is how much time you have to kill.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

You have a real life if and only if you do not compete with anyone in any of
your pursuits.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Only in recent history was &amp;quot;working hard&amp;quot; signaled pride rather than shame for
lack of talent, finesse and mostly, spezzatura.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

What they call &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; (gym, travel, sports) looks like work; the harder they
try, the more captive they are.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

We are hunters; we are only truly alive in those moments when we improvise; no
schedule, just small surprises and stimuli from the environment.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

For everything, use boredom in place of a clock, as a biological wrist-watch,
though under constraints of politeness.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

You exist in full if and only if your conversation (or writings) cannot be
easily reconstructed with clips from other conversations.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Technology is at its best when it is invisible.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

When I look at people on treadmills I wonder how alpha lions, the strongest,
expend the least amount of energy, sleeping twenty hours a day; others hunt for
them.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

You need to keep reminding yourself of the obvious: charm lies in the unsaid,
the unwritten, and the undisplayed. It takes mastery to control silence. Caesar
pontem fecit.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Double a man&amp;#39;s erudition; you will halve his citations.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Never rid anyone of an illusion unless you can replace it in his mind with
another illusion. (But don&amp;#39;t work too hard on it; the replacement illusion does
not even have to be more convincing than the initial one.)

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

The fool views himself as more unique and others more generic; tho wise views
himself as more generic and others more unique.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Finer men tolerate others&amp;#39; small inconsistencies though not the large ones; the
weak tolerats others&amp;#39; large inconsistencies though not small ones.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Mental clarity is the child of courage, not the othe way around. [...] knowledge
is reached (mostly) by removing junk from people&amp;#39;s head.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

The biggest error since Socrates has been to believe that lack of clarity is the
source of all our ills, not the result of them.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Beauty is enhanced by unashamed irregularities; magnificence by a facade of
blunder.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

True humility is when you can surprise yourself more than others; the rest is
either shyness or good marketing.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

You can only convince people who think they can benefit from being convinced.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Greatness starts with the replacement of hatred with polite disdain.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Religions and ethics have evolved from promising heaven if you do good, to
promising heaven while you do good, to making you promise to do good.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Just as dyed hair makes older men less attractive, it is what you do to hide
your weaknesses that makes them repugnant.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

You are only secure if you can lose your fortune without the additional worse
insult of having to become humble.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

Robustness is progress without impatience.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

For the robust, an error is information; for the fragile, an error is an error.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

The imagination of the genius vastly surpasses his intellect; the intellect of
the academic vastly surpasses his imagination.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

The four most influential moderns: Darwin, Marx, Freud and (the productive)
Einstein were scholars but not academics. It has always been hard to do genuine
-- and nonperishable -- work within institutions.

&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

      <title>The Tragedy of the Commons</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; is a well-known economic parable that describes a
scenario where the action that is optimal for each actor leads to global ruin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on
which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, as was the custom in
English villages. He (William Forster Lloyd) postulated that if a herder put
more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, overgrazing could
result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional
benefits, but the whole group shared damage to the commons. If all herders
made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be
depleted or even destroyed, to the detriment of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may remind you of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;the prisoners&amp;#39; dilemna&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which is related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two partners in crime are arrested. The criminals cannot communicate with each
other. The prosecutor offers both criminals a deal: testify and you will be
set free while your accomplice serves a three years term. If both testify,
however, both criminals will spend two years in prison. If none testify, they
will both spend one year in prison. It is assumed that the decision will have
no repercurssions beyond the time spent in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this scenario, the &lt;em&gt;dominant&lt;/em&gt; strategy is to betray one&amp;#39;s partner.
Whatever the partner ends up doing, you&amp;#39;ll end up better if you betray him than
if you don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both the tragedy of the commons and the prisoner&amp;#39;s dilemna, there is a
rational and superior decision for all participants. And yet if everyone picks
this solution, the outcome is worse than what could be achieved through
collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course human beings do not work with mechanistic rationality. The prisoners&amp;#39;
dilemna in particular is very unlikely to play out this way, because of the
stigma incurred by snitching. Beyond that, basic moral principles would probably
factor in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commons-type situations, however, are much more common. On its face, the parable
is about a shared ressource (the titular &amp;quot;commons&amp;quot; — shared pastures). You
probably know fairly well that some people are much less careful with shared
goods than with their own private property. Even more abstract ressources, such
as a buffet or public toilets tend to be abused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of the abuse is this reflection: I won&amp;#39;t pay the consequences, so
why bother? Of course, if everyone thinks like that, there will be consequences,
for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a more global level too, the tragedy of the commons is present. Pollution is
a prime example: if a little bit of pollution will turn a bigger profit, why
abstain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is usually a fairly big moral stigma associated with taking the rationally
selfish decision in a commons-style situation. This is a natural defense again
situations we realize would be ruinous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet being selfish can be so tempting... Not least because it is perfectly
logical. If others are doing it, why should &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; abstain? If no one else is doing
it, where is the harm? Note the similarity to the reasoning in the prisoners&amp;#39;
dilemna: you have cause to be selfish no matter what the others do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other reasons why it is easy being selfish. First, our actions might
seem individually insignificant. Second, unlike the prisoners&amp;#39; dilemna, the
other parties are a vast anonymous mass, to which you owe little or no loyalty.
Being selfish in the prisoners&amp;#39; dilemna is betraying a comrade. Polluting the
environment is, at first approximation, a victimless crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so easy in fact that we are very quick to make the selfish decision, when
no-one is looking or can find out, or when the profit outweighs the loss of
moral status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s why — plot twist — we have regulations and need the government. In
its pure and ideal form, the government is a way to make globally optimal
decisions and ensure that all actors play by the rules. The government proclaims
the rules, sets and enforces punishments in case of violations, and actively
seeks to find out violators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure that the role of the government as a shield against &amp;quot;tragedies of
the commons&amp;quot; is well understood, yet it is absolutely primordial. I&amp;#39;m not sure
even politicians understand it, beyond protecting citizens from violence and
abusive business practices — which to be sure are two important commons-style
situation, but also happen to be those that they can pander with fearmongering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even at a smaller scale, the spirit of the solution is remarkably similar. Make
a binding agreement that includes all concerned parties. Plan for some negative
consequences should the agreement be broken (shame, shunning and exclusion are
good basic tactics), and finally don&amp;#39;t forget to look for violators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I am &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; going to encourage you to act selflessly. You have
nothing to gain, as this article makes clear. But I hope you can now recognize
commons-type situations, and understand the kind of solutions that can be
deployed against them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effective Action is Really, Really Hard</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine there is a cause you care about. This could be poverty, global warming,
or something more humble like increasing the money your town spends on its
youth, or removing these annoying speed bumps from your street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would like to take action to push you cause forward. How do you do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplistic answer is you vote for someone that promises to do something
about your cause. This has many problems. First, some candidate must have
promised he would do something for your cause. Second, you must be inclined to
vote for this candidate, given the rest of his politics. Third, the candidate
must try to keep his word, and must manage to pass the policies you desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a lot of ifs, but we havent even got to the biggest objection: you
actually have no control over whether the candidate gets elected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a small scenario to illustrate: you live in a town with 1000 people, who
all vote; and there are two candidates. Let&amp;#39;s suppose everyone votes at random,
except you. Your vote will make a difference, on average, one time out of a
1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, people do not vote at random, but if you cannot influence their
decision, the result is the same. Overwhelmingly, your vote will not make a
difference. &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there we have our solution: if you want to make a difference, you need to
&lt;strong&gt;influence&lt;/strong&gt; people. In this way, you can have more weight than your allocated
1/1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the most interesting definition of &lt;em&gt;politics&lt;/em&gt; from wiktionary is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political maneuvers or diplomacy between people, groups, or organizations,
especially involving power, influence or conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you influence people? The classical way is to make some kind of
organization with this purpose then hold awareness events, protests, maybe
distribute pamphlets, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this won&amp;#39;t work, or won&amp;#39;t work well enough. If you need to do this, you
cause is not well established, and people won&amp;#39;t care enough to attend your
events. Your proselytism will mildly annoy them at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with voting for candidates is that you are not voting on issues. You
are (ideally...) voting for a program that takes a stance on many issues. Your
advocacy of your cause is probably not enough to shift the balance from one
candidate to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can you do? First, you could try to bypass the government entirely.
You could raise money for the poor or the town youth. But global warming and the
speed bumps? Forget it. Ultimately, most ways in which the world is fucked have
a fundametally political dimension (this time in the sense that they involve the
government, laws or international relationships).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can you do? Try to shape public opinion in favor of the candidate that
favors your cause. We&amp;#39;re now in the realm of mediatic (or even mass-mediatic)
influence. Or, you could try to influence law- and policy-makers directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no longer something you can do on your spare time during the weekend.
You must be in the media and have some decisionary power. You must know
lawmakers and policymakers, and they have to value your input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you dedicate your life to your pet cause, by engaging in a career only
tangentially related to it, in the hopes that you rise high enough to influence
decisions? Should you maybe even go into politics yourself? This all seems like
very bad life advice. If you pick a carreer for the wrong (extrinsic) reasons,
you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be good enough or successful enough at it to make a
difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I saying? Maybe we should accept that, in most political matters, we
have very little influence, hence possibility for action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may be revolting to a lot of you, and it runs quite contrary to the
zeitgeist that says we&amp;#39;re all special snowflakes meant to change the world. But
search your feelings, and you&amp;#39;ll know this to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am not advocating for you to do nothing. Quite to the contrary, I would
encourage you to think deep and hard &lt;strong&gt;about what you can actually do&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s
likely that is much more than you realize, even if it&amp;#39;s at a much more localized
level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many important changes depend on the &amp;quot;the right man&amp;quot; being there &amp;quot;at the right
place&amp;quot;, and also at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be the right man (or woman) at the right place, you first have to be at the
right place. Many carreers will afford you some influence at some level
(unfortunately, some carreers won&amp;#39;t afford you any). Second, you have to be
&lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right&lt;/em&gt; means be the right influence. It means looking at all the facts and
taking the best possible decisions. Because even if the thing you&amp;#39;re weighting
on doesn&amp;#39;t matter that much to you, it may matter a great deal to someone else.
It may even (gasp) be his own pet cause. You may want to listen to these people
(and to the other side, if there is one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to change the world, first be realistic about what your activism
achieves (and if it does achieve something, by all means keep going), then start
looking at what you can actually do, even if it isn&amp;#39;t related to that thing you
really want to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;: At this point, you may protest: &amp;quot;yes, but if everyone thinks like you,
people won&amp;#39;t go voting and the bad guys will win!&amp;quot;. Well, you&amp;#39;re entirely
correct that this is a possible outcome. But that does not make my reasoning any
less true. If you think so, you&amp;#39;re falling victim to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adconseq.html&quot;&gt;Appeal to
Consequences&lt;/a&gt; bias (aka wishful thinking): not believing something is true,
because it being true would have bad consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases where the thing that is individually optimal (in this case, not bothering
to vote, since the impact is negligible) and the thing that is collectively
optimal (everyone taking voting seriously) are well known. They are a
generalization of the classical &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&quot;&gt;Tragedy of the Commons&lt;/a&gt; problem. This will be
the subject of a further blog post. If you&amp;#39;re familiar with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma&quot;&gt;Prisoners&amp;#39;
Dilemna&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;#39;s also the same kind of idea, although at a reduced scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Every Anime I Ever Watched</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t watched very many anime. I am a late bloomer to the whole genra, which
I long dismissed as goofy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was misguided: there is a real diversity of styles and stories in anime.
Many (if not most) of them do beyond the fairly rigid lines inside which most
western TV shows are confined. This is not necessarily a good thing, but it is
the willingness to fully explore a direction or incorporate unusual elements
that often yields brillance. Animation is also a medium that yields a lot of
creative possibilities on a much tighter budget than film. It&amp;#39;s actually a shame
that this medium is treated seriously only in Japan, while here it struggles to
come out of the &amp;quot;for kids&amp;quot; box. If, like I did, you have an unexamined bias
against anime, consider giving them a shot nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pity, as most shows on this list date from my high school (2002-2008)
or even university (2008-2013) years. I, however, was totally unaware that anime
was reaching some new (ongoing) golden era. In retrospect, I identified anime
with things like Dragon Ball, Naruto and Bleach; all of which are long-running
shonen (boy manga) adaptations. This probably explains why I identified anime as
goofy and full of fillers (although shonen does not imply those things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, here is a list of all (15) animes I ever watched, with my
appreciation of them. Don&amp;#39;t expect dazzling insights here. Some of them I
watched quite a while ago, and the impressions that remain are sometimes hazy. I
think that&amp;#39;s interesting though: what impressions remains when the rest is gone.
When other people have interesting things to say about the show, I&amp;#39;ll point to
them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anime appear in chronological order of me watching them (as far as I can
remember).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sword-art-online&quot;&gt;Sword Art Online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got inspired to watch Sword Art Online because I liked its MMORPG theme. I had
a bit of a love story with early World of Warcraft, followed by a subsequent
disillusion about MMORPGs, which I think is a genre that is exploited well
beyond its enormous potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, MMORPG-themed anime are an emerging genra known as &lt;em&gt;isekai&lt;/em&gt;. I
didn&amp;#39;t know that as I set out to watch SAO though, and was mostly drawn in by
how gorgeous and ambitious the MMO featured in the show seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This show became really popular, and attracted a lot of criticism as the show&amp;#39;s
popularity was perceived to be completely disproportionate to its quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a comprehensive summary of the criticism against this anime, check
out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uON7ANNOi4&quot;&gt;Sword Art Online - An Analytical Diatribe&lt;/a&gt; by anime commentator
Digibro. I will simply say that while I agree with most of what he has to say, I
enjoyed the show nonetheless. A bit like Doctor Who, this show works best when
you don&amp;#39;t question its premises too hard. The show works well with simple
emotions and many sections manage to be touching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have to rewatch the show to be able to articulate why I liked it so
much. I think the first half of the first season is the strongest part of the
show, while its second part is the weakest. The second season is more equal,
packing great action in its first part and some emotional punch in the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a show so polarizing, the best thing you can do is give it a try. No need
to be particularly patient: if you don&amp;#39;t enjoy the first few episode, the show
is not cut out for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;neon-genesis-evangelion&quot;&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelion, or Eva for short, is one of the most iconic anime out there. It&amp;#39;s a
mecha anime, with a heavily cabbalistic motif, and psychological themes. Dating
from 1995, it&amp;#39;s also the oldest anime series on this list, a cult classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aesthetics of the show are wonderful, and it&amp;#39;s easy to see how it was such
an influence (something which I was told rather than noticed myself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My big problem with this show is it&amp;#39;s main protagonist, Shinji. Shinji has
troubles you see. Shinji is sad and just &lt;em&gt;does not want&lt;/em&gt; to fight in the robot.
Of course, that&amp;#39;s supposed to be one of the big theme of the series, but after a
while it just isn&amp;#39;t enjoyable anymore and if you&amp;#39;re like me, you&amp;#39;ll find
yourself singing &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/ferrousfellow/shinji-get-in-the-robot&quot;&gt;Shinji get in the robot&lt;/a&gt; (also see the hilarious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygWPB_FevFU&quot;&gt;Yo!
version&lt;/a&gt;). If you can get past Shinji, the show is well worth a watch though. I
definitely don&amp;#39;t regret watching it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 10 June&lt;/strong&gt;: Youtuber Aleczandxr has put a video that, while
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocmBWomlwsY&quot;&gt;Why I Don&amp;#39;t Like Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/a&gt;, actually does a
very good job at explaining how alienation is treated very stongly in
Evangelion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second sidebar: for some reason, anime showmaker seem to have a fascination with
mystical, and often cabbalistic motifs. Considering only this list, these motifs
can be found in Eva, Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist and Code Geass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;guilty-crown&quot;&gt;Guilty Crown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Evangelion very much. So much in fact that I went looking for a show
like it, and that&amp;#39;s how, in some roundabout way I ended up with Guilty Crown.
Unbeknownst to me, Guilty Crown is actually much closer to Code Geass (see
later) than Evangelion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series start off on a strong premise, but its second half is a bit too much
for me. And it suffers from the same flaw as Code Geass: plot developments are
kind of ex machinima, and the series finds itself trapped inside the exponential
development of its own &amp;quot;logic&amp;quot;, threatening the suspension of disbelief
necessary to enjoy shows like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s incredibly well animated however (it&amp;#39;s from the same director as Death Note
and Attack on Titan), and if you think that Code Geass is the best thing since
sliced bread, you ought to watch this one as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly1ETP8lU0Q&quot;&gt;How to direct mainstream anime&lt;/a&gt; by Digibro does a really good job of
describing the appeal of the show, more eloquently than I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fullmetal-alchemist-fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood&quot;&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist &amp;amp; Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of the brothers Alphonse and Edward Elric is great. So great, in fact,
that it warranted not one, but two anime adaptations. One in 2003 and one in
2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are very good, but it is widely recognized that the &lt;em&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/em&gt; (2009)
version is the superior one by a very wide margin. Both shows are nearly
identical for the first ten episodes, then diverge wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic pitch is that young Alphonse and Edward live with their mother, their
father having left for god-knows-where. Both kids show a rare aptitude for
Alchemy (essentially transformative magic). When their mother dies, the grief
pushes them to try something forbidden and bring their mother back to life. This
doesn&amp;#39;t work and backfires badly besides, as Alphonse loses his body (but not
his soul, which Edward manages to bind to a big-ass suit of armor in extremis),
and Edward loses an arm and a leg (to be replaced with bionic implements). Our
heroes then embark on a quest to get their bodies back and uncover dark secrets
in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both shows are very accessible: they fit our idea of what a cartoon depicting a
heroic story should be. The story is great, the world-building frankly amazing
(especially in Brotherhood), and the shows features a strong cast of secondary
characters. Nevertheless, it is an anime, and it does feature some of the
genre&amp;#39;s quirks. The thoughts of many characters are very much on display. This
focus on &amp;quot;self-talk&amp;quot; is commonplace in anime, but rare in western flits. The
villains are also slightly disturbing, another thing that anime tends to do
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist is perhaps the perfect gateway drug into anime, and even if
you don&amp;#39;t end up being an anime guy or gal, you might just end up liking this
one. Brotherhood is currently the second-best rated anime
on &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php&quot;&gt;MyAnimeList.net&lt;/a&gt;, and that makes it as close to an anime plebiscite
as you&amp;#39;ll ever get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Brotherhood is the superior version, I suggest you start with the 2003
version if you intend to watch both like I did. Both are good, but I&amp;#39;m afraid
the 2003 version will be a letdown after watching Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;log-horizon&quot;&gt;Log Horizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Sword Art Online, Log Horizon is about people getting trapped inside a MMO,
but that&amp;#39;s about where the similarity ends. Log Horizon is less concerned about
the animation and drama, but more about building a fully-fleshed coherent
worlds, where the protagonists have to contend with this new universe as they
progressively uncovers its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cast is a strong reason to like the show, it&amp;#39;s just eminently lovable. The
main guy — Shiroe — is this bespectacled sly schemer, but with a heart of gold,
and otherwise a perfectly sensible guy. His companions each bring something of
their own, and it&amp;#39;s a pleasure to see them work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is really well-done, and the mysteries are intertwined with the game
mechanics (which will look familiar to anyone who ever played an MMO). The
heroes attempt to discover how (and why) this world works, even while they have
to deal the threats it throws at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only bad thing about Log Horizon is that it is unfinished. But apparently
work on the source material (a light novel) is still ongoing, even though it&amp;#39;s
barely ahead of the anime at this point. So there is hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;attack-on-titan&quot;&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to do justice to Attack on Titan with words alone, because this show
is all about its over the top animation and its epic-sized story. The combat
choreography is really impressive. Just watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGRm4IzK1SQ&quot;&gt;this trailer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story takes place in a world where titans - almost indestructible monstruous
giant humanoids roam free. To protect itself, what remains of humanity has
erected three giant concentric walls behind which they found safety. Things are
peaceful, until a giant titan appears and breaches the outer wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is — and it is many things — Attack on Titan is never boring. I
suggest you give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aforementionned video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly1ETP8lU0Q&quot;&gt;How to direct mainstream anime&lt;/a&gt; also touches on the
greatness of this show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, something that figures very prominently in Attack on Titan is
the space given to the characters&amp;#39; thoughts. This is a somewhat common anime
trait. Some long minutes are spend within some characters&amp;#39; inner monologue, and,
somewhat amazingly, it (mostly) works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kanon-2006-&quot;&gt;Kanon (2006)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanon is something very different from everything so far. It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;cute anime&amp;quot;.
It was adapted from a successful visual novel (an interactive conversation-based
video game).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows protagonist Yuichi Aizawa as he moves in with his aunt and cousin,
which live in another town and starts classes in a new school. The story
revolves around Yuichi&amp;#39;s encounters with a few girls and how he gets to know
them and help them overcome their problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very well done. It&amp;#39;s very innocent, mostly light but with some depth thrown
in at the right places. There is a sort of poesy to it. This is not the kind of
show that you want to binge watch. It requires a bit of a contemplative mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally watched this show because it was the favorite anime of the
machinima/AMV maker &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/snobaste/videos&quot;&gt;Snoman&lt;/a&gt;. Check out his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiZkNl164CsD5zBoEpWgV6Wi6aZgX0fvM&quot;&gt;Dreamscape&lt;/a&gt; series, a favorite of
mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I liked it. But it&amp;#39;s the kind of show I wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily seek
out, and I probably want to space them out healthily, lest they become a bore or
lose their magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-geass&quot;&gt;Code Geass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Geass is one of the most popular anime shows in the last decade. It follows
the story of Lelouch, secretly the son of Brittania&amp;#39;s emperor, who went into
hiding after his mother was assassinated by a rival faction and Brittania
invaded Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lelouch hates Brittania — and his father — with a passion, and has woved to
avenge his mother. His dreams become possible as he acquires a very special
power. So, using his superior intellect and enlisting the help of the Japanese
rebellion, he sets to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anime is good, but I have some reservations about it. Plot developments feel
very ex machina. For a show that puts forward the intellectual and planning
capability of his main protagonist, this is a bit jarring. This is a sharp
contrast with Log Horizon, where Shiroe&amp;#39;s ability is extremely believable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Lelouch and Suzaku (his frenemy) reason is also really baffling at
times. This holds true even when they make emotional or value-based decisions.
This is relatively common in anime (and maybe a certain culture gap is to
blame), but reaches impressive heights in Code Geass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to like the first season more than the second, which is apparently not
the consensus. The second season escalates the stakes &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. Accordingly,
characters evolve and turn somewhat parodic as they try to juggle all these
responsibilities. This seems interesting, but only magnifies the aforementionned
flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also interesting that I was much more positive while watching it. The first
season went into a satisfying crescendo, although I object strongly to a big
ex-machina at the end. The second season was less brilliant, but what really
disappointed me in retrospect was the resolution. There are a few mysteries
teased out during the show, and they aren&amp;#39;t really resolved to my satisfaction.
Some aren&amp;#39;t resolved, while other are but don&amp;#39;t impact the story. In particular,
a very big mystery is unceremonioulsy expedited in one or two episodes, and
happens to have very little bearing on the plot whatsoever, while on the outset
it feels like this could underpin the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, Code Geass is well worth watching. Nevertheless, if I had to
pick the most overhyped one in this list, it would be this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cowboy-bebop&quot;&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;#39;re on the topic of overhyped, welcome Cowboy Bebop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My impression of Cowboy Bebop is that it&amp;#39;s an impressive anime — one with mature
themes and a real reflection — which happens to be buried in a heap of goofy
filler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cowboy Bebop is overhyped not because it&amp;#39;s bad, but because it is held in an
almost cult-like following by some people. Nevertheless, my critique (about
fillers) is probably the one most frequently leveraged against the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise is rather simple, and I&amp;#39;ll quote wikipedia here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original crew are Spike Spiegel, an exiled former hitman of the criminal
Red Dragon Syndicate, and his partner Jet Black, a former ISSP officer. They
are later joined by Faye Valentine, an amnesiac con artist; Edward Wong, an
eccentric girl skilled in hacking; and Ein, a genetically-engineered Pembroke
Welsh Corgi with human-like intelligence. Over the course of the series, the
team get involved in disastrous mishaps leaving them out of pocket, while
often confronting faces and events from their past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the crew&amp;#39;s misfortunes is that they are all really silly and
sort-of slapstick, while the shows&amp;#39; aestehtic is more Noir/Western. This was a
bit of a mood spoiler for me, in a show that is all about mood (featuring by the
way, really great music).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, if you manage to power through the initial filler (I almost didn&amp;#39;t), I
don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll regret watching Cowboy Bebop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need convincing, listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip5CpjXR4CI&quot;&gt;this elegy&lt;/a&gt; of the show by Digibro. I think
Cowboy Bebop deserves that praise, but it&amp;#39;s hard to see at first, especially if
you&amp;#39;re not looking at the right place like I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Cowboy Bebop leaves me with a bittersweet taste, and not only
because it tells a bittersweet story. It could have been so much better with a
few adjustment. I feel like there&amp;#39;s a better, leaner story trying to get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s just say that if I won the lottery, a fan cut of Cowboy Bebbop would
probably be a worthwhile project to saddle myself with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;konosuba-&quot;&gt;Konosuba!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched Konosuba! after hearing Digibro praise it so much (see for instance
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-sZAPBIcQM&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic premise is that this is a parody of the isekai &amp;quot;trapped in a MMO&amp;quot;
genre (things like Sword Art Online and Log Horizon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Digibro, I wouldn&amp;#39;t call the show hilarious, but it&amp;#39;s strangely endearing
and it almost always brought a smile to my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I complained a lot about goofiness before, but this is goofiness done
right, and for its own sake. Despite that, the story-telling and world-building
are strong, and we&amp;#39;re not just fed a series of clip, but rather an adventure in
a universe that feels alive. Like Digibro alluded to, the story builds upon its
own gags as a way to move the plot forward, and that&amp;#39;s a big part of the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly recommended if you&amp;#39;re looking for something light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;yuri-on-ice&quot;&gt;Yuri!! on Ice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anime about gay figure skaters. Doesn&amp;#39;t that sound awesome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it is. I watched this one with my girlfriend, who&amp;#39;s totally a fan, and we
had a blast. It&amp;#39;s a nice story, sentimal at times, but in a way that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few notables things about the show (some of which are, again, inspired by
Digibro&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MxbvZ2Wd5I&quot;&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s rare for a show to feature a main character this age and position. Yuri
is 24 and he&amp;#39;s an ice skater nearing the end of his carreer. He doesn&amp;#39;t have
to prove himself, but rather he wants to go out in style, and that&amp;#39;s an
interesting change. While he&amp;#39;s obviously great at figure skating, he&amp;#39;s also
not a &amp;quot;genius&amp;quot; the way some other characters are. He spent a huge amount of
time practicing (and sacrificing some of his youth in the process). That&amp;#39;s a
nice difference from most anime heroes who seemingly get all their skills for
free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first half of the season is better than the second half, which focuses a
bit too much on the skating competitions. However at this point you&amp;#39;re likely
to be fully on board so you shouldn&amp;#39;t feel the pain too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show is very realistic. The skating is realistic, maybe too much so as you
sometimes can&amp;#39;t tell who is doing well and who isn&amp;#39;t. The characters are
colorful, but authentic. The show features social media heavily (mostly
Instagram and online streaming) in a way that is familiar, clever &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;
relevant to the story. This contributes to firmly anchor the show in our
modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;serial-experiments-lain&quot;&gt;Serial Experiments Lain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have little to say about this one as I stopped watching right after the first
episode. Serial Experiments Lain is widely considered to be a masterpiece, but I
really didn&amp;#39;t dig the mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I knew beforehand and the first episode, I would say that alienation
and, more broadly, psychology of the less happy kind are pre-eminent themes of
this show. This is amplified by an oppressive art direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelion was almost too much for me, and it has awesome colorful robot fights.
So I didn&amp;#39;t pursue. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll revisit some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, many people think it&amp;#39;s the best thing since sliced bread, so do
get other opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gurren-lagann&quot;&gt;Gurren Lagann&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurren Lagann is awesome, as per the dated definition: &amp;quot;Causing awe or terror;
inspiring wonder or excitement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://norswap.com/gurren-lagann-reaction/&quot;&gt;a brief&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about it, here&amp;#39;s what I had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anime is completely over-the-top, but somehow it all works out beautiful.
It&amp;#39;s an ode to fighting spirit, and the force of will. It&amp;#39;s pure motivation
cranked out to 10. I know it will stay with me a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s actually more subtle than that. Yes it&amp;#39;s over-the-top, but the rules
that preside over the world are so loose that the story does not seem disjointed
or driven by ex machinas. The logic driving the show has its own consistency;
and despite how miraculous things turn out, one never feels betrayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the show has a surprising amount of maturity to it, albeit this maturity
is hidden beneath the surface. This is mostly manifested in the character&amp;#39;s
reaction to some pretty shaking events; and how, ultimately, they react to them
in a way that is, for lack of a better word, healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a very good analysis of these aspect of the show by Aleczandxr, but it
completely spoils the plot: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m19OsgLMkI&quot;&gt;Gurren Lagann&amp;#39;s Underappreciated Maturity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my two favorite anime of the list (along with Log Horizon), and
so of course it comes highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiZkNl164CsCwiN9tAyzxf6xU08msx-QS&quot;&gt;Epic Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;black-lagoon&quot;&gt;Black Lagoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Lagoon tells the story of a former Japanese salaryman that integrates a
small crew of mercenaries. It was recommended to me by a few friends who said it
was their favorite anime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this show gets right is the mood: this is what I expected Cowboy Bebop to
feel like (adjusted for context). Some charcters also undergo interesting
character development, especially towards the beginning of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most frustrating thing with this anime is that it doesn&amp;#39;t have a
proper ending. Very much like Log Horizon, it is based on a manga series that is
ongoing (albeit very slowly). The ending we got may qualify as a pseudo-ending
but it was definitely below the expectations set by the beginning of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid anime, well worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming Sucks</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks&quot;&gt;http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every programmer occasionally, when nobody’s home, turns off the lights, pours a
glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on
their computer. It’s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote
it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the
lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the
rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in
the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and
variables. It’s concise. It doesn’t do anything obviously stupid. It has never
had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one,
mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person,
and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over
thirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every programmer starts out writing some perfect little snowflake like this.
Then they’re told on Friday they need to have six hundred snowflakes written by
Tuesday, so they cheat a bit here and there and maybe copy a few snowflakes and
try to stick them together or they have to ask a coworker to work on one who
melts it and then all the programmers’ snowflakes get dumped together in some
inscrutable shape and somebody leans a Picasso on it because nobody wants to see
the cat urine soaking into all your broken snowflakes melting in the light of
day. Next week, everybody shovels more snow on it to keep the Picasso from
falling over.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hot Take: Gurren Lagann</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gurren-lagann-reaction/team-gurren.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just watched the anime &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann&quot;&gt;Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann&lt;/a&gt;. And: oh. my.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly I&amp;#39;m almost exactly 10 years late to the party. But if you are too and
have no prejudice against anime&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;, do yourself a favour and watch it;
especially if you sometimes struggle with motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anime is completely over-the-top, but somehow it all works out beautiful.
It&amp;#39;s an ode to fighting spirit, and the force of will. It&amp;#39;s pure motivation
cranked out to 10. I know it will stay with me a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt; Anime is probably one of the most inventive medium currently out there. I
really should write about it sometimes. It was prejudiced against it enough in
my youth that I didn&amp;#39;t explore it. I could say I regret it, but I prefer to
think it&amp;#39;s just more good stuff to feed on now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflets d&#39;Acide: It&#39;s (Finally) Over</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/reflets-d-acides-fini/rda.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you speak French and do not know about it yet, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.refletsdacide.com/presentation/&quot;&gt;Reflets d&amp;#39;Acide&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#39;s an humourous fantasy &amp;quot;mp3 saga&amp;quot; (apparently the proper english term is
&amp;quot;audio drama&amp;quot;). It&amp;#39;s now finally complete (well, the first season) after more
than 10 years in the running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It distinguishes itself from other offerings in the same vein by its subtle
humor, layered construction and masterful use of the French language. It even
uses a non-trivial amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alexandrine#English&quot;&gt;alexandrines&lt;/a&gt; being used. It&amp;#39;s a bombastic love
letter to French, laid out in the least boring way possible: as a delightful
heroic fantasy tale. I still find things in there after listening to it at least
ten times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about any English-language equivalent. At the very least, they
haven&amp;#39;t had the same kind of impact on geek culture as Reflets d&amp;#39;Acide and other
sagas (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.penofchaos.com/warham/donjon-resume.htm&quot;&gt;Le Donjon de Naheulbeuk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knarfworld.net/episodes&quot;&gt;Les Aventuriers du Survivaure&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adoprixtoxis.com/lite/download/adop_downloads.php&quot;&gt;Adoprixtoxis&lt;/a&gt;) have had in the French-speaking parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest thing I can think of is the much more recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pretendwizards.com/&quot;&gt;Pretend Wizards&lt;/a&gt;. Know
any other? Let me know &lt;a href=&quot;/reflets-d-acides-fini/#disqus_thread&quot;&gt;in the comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LaTeX Tooling Guide</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll let you in on a small secret: I hate LaTeX with a passion. It&amp;#39;s a bloated
mess with crazy syntax. It generates reams of warnings you can never totally get
rid of, and some of the most confusing and/or unhelpeful errors I have ever
seen. It needs to be run N times in a row. It even has a stupid name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Knuth wrote TeX, and it may have been art. But, to use a fashionable word,
TeX was never meant to scale to LaTeX. Pervasive use of non-hygienic macros and
constant manipulations of global values is a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could avoid LaTeX completely, unfortuately conferences have templates
and the only other format available is MS Word, which has its own flaws (as I
recall, in how it handles numbering and floating figures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, the current article is about how I setup my Latex to alleviate some of
these pains. I&amp;#39;ll start with a tour of what I use, then give you &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/template-sigplan/blob/master/makefile&quot;&gt;a makefile&lt;/a&gt;
and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/template-sigplan&quot;&gt;example git repository&lt;/a&gt; to bring all these tools together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;installing-and-updating&quot;&gt;Installing and Updating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Choosing_a_LaTeX_Compiler&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about available Latex distributions. I
recommend sticking to the tried-and-true, so that would be MiKTeX for Windows,
MacTeX for OSX and TeX Live for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have a Latex distribution installed, but it is not up to date,
this fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/55437/how-do-i-update-my-tex-distribution&quot;&gt;TeX Stack Exchange answer&lt;/a&gt; will tell you how to
update it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;editors&quot;&gt;Editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people will use some kind of Latex-mode that comes with their editor of
choice. I edit text in Emacs, and so I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/&quot;&gt;Auctex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it might be nicer to have something closer to an IDE for Latex. My
option of choice here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texstudio.org/&quot;&gt;TeXstudio&lt;/a&gt;. Even though most of my Latex editing is in
Auctex, I use it from time to time to typeset math or help with diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, but perhaps most importantly, there are a few online Latex editors. The
best of them is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sharelatex.com/&quot;&gt;ShareLaTeX&lt;/a&gt;. Its great strength is that it saves you from doing
any kind of setup, and in my own experience is super reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ShareLatex also filters out unhelpful warning and errors and does its best to
correlated what is left with your source file. Later in this guide we will show
command line tools that do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s good enough as an editor, but also allows realtime collaboration on a
document. Best of all, it now has the ability to sync with GitHub, meaning you
can mix online and offline collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the famous annoyances of Latex is that it needs to be run multiple times
to get references right, interleaved with runs of your bibliography tool
(usually BibTeX or Biber).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately this whole process can be automated. Most Latex distribution come
with a tool called &lt;code&gt;latexmk&lt;/code&gt;, which does automates all these invocations for
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware that &lt;code&gt;latexmk&lt;/code&gt; requires Perl to run, which is not bundled with Latex.
This tends to be a caveat on Windows. If you are running Windows and want to use
&lt;code&gt;latexmk&lt;/code&gt;, install &lt;a href=&quot;http://strawberryperl.com/&quot;&gt;Strawberry Perl&lt;/a&gt; to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a better tool, though, which is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aclements/latexrun&quot;&gt;latexrun&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;latexrun&lt;/code&gt; does what
&lt;code&gt;latexmk&lt;/code&gt; does, but also sanitizes Latex&amp;#39;s output to only show helpful errors,
similar to what you would see on ShareLatex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;latexrun&lt;/code&gt; is a single Python3 script, which is great for portability. You can
even drop it directly in your paper&amp;#39;s git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;errors&quot;&gt;Errors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re using ShareLatex or &lt;code&gt;latexrun&lt;/code&gt;, you&amp;#39;re already pretty well covered
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more tool that bears mentioning: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dmwit/pulp&quot;&gt;pulp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;pulp&lt;/code&gt; lets you filter out
unwanted warnings and errors, and tries to correlated errors with file
positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pulp&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#39;s output is less pretty than that of &lt;code&gt;latexrun&lt;/code&gt;, but its great strength
is that it lets define custom filtering rules, to remove those annoying warnings
that you cannot get rid of, but break nothing. Or, more frequently, comes from
the class file that you are forced to use to submit you paper (I&amp;#39;m looking at
you, ACM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an exemple of filtering spec to get rid of all errors that pop up when
compiling the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/&quot;&gt;acmart&lt;/a&gt; example file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;!(boring | info | message | under | over
| p &amp;quot;hyperref&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;Token not allowed in a PDF string&amp;quot;
| &amp;quot;Class acmart Info&amp;quot;
| &amp;quot;file:line:error style messages enabled&amp;quot;
| &amp;quot;Excluding.*comment&amp;quot;
| &amp;quot;Processing.*comment&amp;quot;
| &amp;quot;Include comment&amp;quot;
| &amp;quot;comment.cut&amp;quot;
| &amp;quot;(msharpe)&amp;quot;
| &amp;quot;]&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !&amp;quot;..&amp;quot;
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first line matches &lt;code&gt;pulp&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#39;s default specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pulp&lt;/code&gt; can be integrated with &lt;code&gt;latexmk&lt;/code&gt; fairly easily, by means of a
configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pulp&lt;/code&gt; is not as friendly to install as the other tools. Here is how to install
on OSX, assuming you already have &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt; (on other platforms, you just need
to install the Haskell platform in some other way):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew cask install haskell-platform
git clone https://github.com/dmwit/pulp.git
cabal update
cabal install
PATH=&amp;quot;$HOME/Library/Haskell/bin:$PATH&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;preview&quot;&gt;Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;#39;re working with TeXstudio or ShareLatex, you&amp;#39;ll need to preview the
generated PDF files using a PDF viewer. You want to use one that picks up
changes to the PDF on the disk, and reloads it on the fly, while keeping your
position in the PDF. On OSX, the built-in viewer (confusingly named &lt;em&gt;Preview&lt;/em&gt;)
does this adequately. On Windows, I&amp;#39;m partial to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html&quot;&gt;Sumatra PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;latexmk&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;latexrun&lt;/code&gt; will automatically open a generated PDF file (using the
OS-determined associated tool).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-together&quot;&gt;All Together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve put together &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/template-sigplan&quot;&gt;a repository&lt;/a&gt; that serves as template for papers using
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/&quot;&gt;ascmart sigplan&lt;/a&gt; style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooling centers around &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/template-sigplan/blob/master/makefile&quot;&gt;a makefile&lt;/a&gt;. The default configuration is to use
&lt;code&gt;latexmk&lt;/code&gt; with pulp integration. The following commands are available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;make view&lt;/code&gt;: generates the PDF file and displays it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;make pdf&lt;/code&gt;: generates the PDF file but does not display it; latex is run silently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;make verbose&lt;/code&gt;: like &lt;code&gt;make pdf&lt;/code&gt;, but shows error details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;make rebuild&lt;/code&gt;: forces a rebuild of the pdf, even if no changes are picked up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;make clean&lt;/code&gt;: removes all temporary files (for all tools!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;make mrproper&lt;/code&gt;: like &lt;code&gt;make clean&lt;/code&gt;, but also removes the generated PDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have &lt;code&gt;pulp&lt;/code&gt;, just delete or rename the &lt;code&gt;.latexmkrc&lt;/code&gt; file from the
repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;latexmk&lt;/code&gt; is not found or doesn&amp;#39;t work (for instance if Perl is not
installed), the makefile will fall back to using plain make rules, and &lt;code&gt;make
pdf&lt;/code&gt; will be verbose by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to use &lt;code&gt;latexrun&lt;/code&gt;, which is bundled in the repository, by
running &lt;code&gt;make run&lt;/code&gt; (Python3 required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pulp&lt;/code&gt; can be run standalone with &lt;code&gt;make pulp&lt;/code&gt; (pulp is not bundled in the
repository), assuming a compilation was attempted earlier and the &lt;code&gt;.log&lt;/code&gt; file is
left uncleaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/strong&gt;: I won&amp;#39;t be too assiduous in maintaining this makefile, and it
may even contain a few bugs. It should be taken as an example of how to do
things, rather than as a toolchain to be relied on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this, you&amp;#39;ll have no Latex excuses for turning your next paper late :)&lt;/p&gt;
