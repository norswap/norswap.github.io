<p>This cannot be summarized in full, but it is a joy to read, and comes with an
important lesson for your arguments and debates.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the key takeaway, and a taste:</p>
<p>There are a series of disputes on categories, which are really disputes on the
definition of the category. (Is a whale a fish? Is gender dysphoria a mental
illness?)</p>
<p>In reality, multiple definitions often makes sense. The key being to pick the
right one for the task at hand. An alternative categorization system is not an
error. You draw category boundaries in specific ways to capture tradeoffs you
care about.</p>
<p>The (controversial) hair dryer incident:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This one obsessive compulsive woman would drive to work every morning and
worry she had left the hair dryer on and it was going to burn down her house.
So she’d drive back home to check that the hair dryer was off, then drive back
to work, then worry that maybe she hadn’t really checked well enough, then
drive back, and so on ten or twenty times a day [...] to the point where her
career was in a downspin and she thought she would have to quit and go on
disability. [...]</p>
<p>She’d seen countless psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors, she’d
done all sorts of therapy, she’d taken every medication in the book, and none of
them had helped. [...]</p>
<p>So she came to my hospital and was seen by a colleague of mine, who told her
“Hey, have you thought about just bringing the hair dryer with you?”</p>
<p>And it worked.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Musashi is quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut
the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch
the enemy’s cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is
essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or
touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, the primary thing in psychiatry is to help the patient, whatever the
means. Someone can concern-troll that the hair dryer technique leaves
something to be desired in that it might have prevented the patient from
seeking a more thorough cure that would prevent her from having to bring the
hair dryer with her. But compared to the alternative of “nothing else works”
it seems clearly superior.</p>

<p>The time diaries revealed that both groups (elite and average players) spent, on
average, the same number of hours on music per week (around 50).</p>

stretching your ability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability and
determination. But there&#39;s a third ingredient that&#39;s not as well understood:
an obsessive interest in a particular topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you look at the lives of people who&#39;ve done great work, you see a
consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket collector&#39;s obsessive
interest in something that would have seemed pointless to most of their
contemporaries. One of the most striking features of Darwin&#39;s book about his
voyage on the Beagle is the sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His
curiosity seems infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out
on his slate what happens to series.</p>
<p>But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket collector. Series
matter, and bus tickets don&#39;t.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a mistake to think they were &quot;laying the groundwork&quot; for the discoveries
they made later. There&#39;s too much intention in that metaphor. Like bus ticket
collectors, they were doing it because they liked it.</p>
<p>If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might be it: to
have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.</p>
<p>Aren&#39;t I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you might
think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for ability and a
substitute for determination. Unless you have sufficient mathematical
aptitude, you won&#39;t find series interesting. And when you&#39;re obsessively
interested in something, you don&#39;t need as much determination: you don&#39;t need
to push yourself as hard when curiosity is pulling you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an obsession might
be one that matters. For example, it&#39;s more promising if you&#39;re creating
something, rather than just consuming something someone else creates. It&#39;s
more promising if something you&#39;re interested in is difficult, especially if
it&#39;s more difficult for other people than it is for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But you can never be sure. In fact, here&#39;s an interesting idea that&#39;s also
rather alarming if it&#39;s true: it may be that to do great work, you also have
to waste a lot of time.</p>

utter wastes of time in the first place.</p>

<p><a href="http://tynan.com/thekey">Consistency is The Key</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most productive people I know are people who absolutely master the basics.
They know how to fill the time in the day with the most important tasks they
have, and they know how to string those days together in such a way that
they&#39;re making meaningful progress.</p>
<p>The most important basic skill to master, without a doubt, is consistency.
Those who are able to be consistent end up with huge success, very often much
greater success than they expected or even hoped for.</p>
<p>People in finance say that people aren&#39;t able to comprehend the benefits of
compounding interest over time. Consistency in productivity creates compound
benefits which people are similarly not able to comprehend. Your starting
point doesn&#39;t matter, because you can quickly scale up to your capacity once
you have a history and habit of consistency.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say you wanted to write a book. Maybe you&#39;d tried and failed before. If
you commit to writing for thirty minutes every day for a month, you&#39;ll write
at least 10 to 15 thousand words. Not bad. Then the next month you up your
quota to just one hour. Now you have a cumulative 30 to 45 thousand words. Not
quite a book yet, but you&#39;re a month away.</p>
<p>And how easy does that process sound? Anyone can do half an hour a day. Anyone
who has done a half hour a day for a month can do an hour a day. And anyone
who has done an hour a day can do another month.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, it doesn&#39;t seem to matter what you choose to be consistent on
or how easy or difficult it is. I&#39;ve experimented a lot with this, and even
the easiest tasks lead to a positive spiral of consistency. I&#39;ve found that as
soon as I get a coaching client to be consistent with any tasks relevant to
their lives, they will generally remain consistent forever, with a few
variances here and there</p>

<p>There’s a type of joke that I think of as the “white people” joke, although
it’s rarely funny and it doesn’t have to be about someone who’s white. The
joke is about a mid-40’s housewife who is way too well-educated and bored to
be a housewife, and so she tries to find the Grail of healthy food (organic,
GMO-free, low acidity, one diet after another) and she plants a garden, and
she adopts pets, and she joins nonprofits, and she joins the school board, and
she reads every novel on NPR’s end of the year list, and she gets weekly
therapy and monthly massages (to about the same effect), and she meditates on
the present, and she achieves peace with the past, and she contemplates the
future, and everything is feng shui, and yet, despite all this, she feels
restless, anxious, unhappy, and she dreams of some sort of vacation.</p>
<p>Or sometimes the joke is about an elderly businessman on his second hair
transplant and third cardiac stent and twenty-billionth dollar, and his kids
all have grandkids and his wife is deceased, and when he goes out he he orders
scotch more expensive than houses, but that isn’t too often—he’s seen enough
parties, he’s seen enough people, he has no strong affections, and he works
round the clock fighting tooth-and-nail for his billions, because he’s not
sure what else, exactly, he’s supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>Or the joke is about a magazine-cover movie actress who has the adoration of
thousands and still feels worthless. Or the joke is about a virginal computer
science genius who has deleted his OKCupid and decided to eschew all noncoding
activities. Or the joke is about a millionaire athlete under investigation for
using anabolic steroids. Or the joke is about a 50-something cardiologist who
hates all his patients but knows that he’d hate being retired even more. Or
the joke is about a young power couple who like each other very much, love,
maybe, but they’re both distracted by the nagging feeling that they could do
better, that they should be shooting for something greater, and so they break
up and find new partners and the process repeats again.</p>
<p>And the joke, which you hear on forums or sitcoms or in crowded sports bars,
goes: “Haha, even though these people are successful, they’re still
dissatisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>And I’m here to tell you that this joke is totally backwards. It’s because
these people have always been dissatisfied that they achieved success.</p>
