      <title>A simple Java Lexer</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I just released &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/java-lexer&quot;&gt;java-lexer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se9/html/jls-3.html&quot;&gt;JLS&lt;/a&gt;-compliant yet simplistic lexer for the
Java language. It&amp;#39;s completely stand-alone and not dependent on any parser or
other libraries. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/java-lexer&quot;&gt;Check it out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insights From &quot;The Denial of Death&quot;</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death&quot;&gt;The Denial of Death&lt;/a&gt; is book by Ernest Becker that earned the Pulitzer
for non-ficiton in 1974. The basic premise of the book is that man is trapped in
between his &amp;quot;creatureliness&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;symbolic self&amp;quot;. Consciousness has made man
aware of his own powers, but also of his miserable creatureliness and his
destiny to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t read the book, but found a lot of gems in
this &lt;a href=&quot;https://taylorpearson.me/book-review/denial-death-summary-quotes/&quot;&gt;compilation of selected quotes&lt;/a&gt; made by Taylor Pearson. I also
drew from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a summary of some interesting points made by the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-urge-to-heroism&quot;&gt;The Urge to Heroism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our motivations have often more to do with the need to achieve than with the
matter at hand. Making a killing in business or on the battlefield frequently
has less to do with economic need or political reality than with the need for
assuring ourselves that we have achieved something of lasting worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In man a working level of narcissism is inseparable from self-esteem, from a
basic sense of self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urge to heroism is natural, and to admit it honest. For everyone to admit it
would probably release such pent-up force as to be devastating to societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societies, except primitive ones, cannot provide to men a path to heroism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity achieved it to some extent, by mere participation: it could take
the simple and the mighty, and make them all secure heroes, simply by taking a
step back from the world into another dimension: that of heaven. Christianity
took creature consciousness — the thing man most wanted to deny — and made it
the very condition for his cosmic heroism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But humanity&amp;#39;s traditional &amp;quot;hero-systems&amp;quot;, such as religion, are no longer
convincing in the age of reason. Science attempts to serve as an immortality
project (see below), something it can never do, because it is unable to provide
agreeable, absolute meanings to human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become conscious of what one is doing to earn his feeling of heroism is the
main self-analytic problem of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crisis of modern society is precisely that the youth no longer feel heroic
in the plan for action that their culture has set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern man cannot find his heroism in everyday life any more, as men did in
traditional societies just by doing their daily duty of raising children,
working, and worshipping. He needs revolutions and wars and &amp;quot;continuing&amp;quot;
revolutions to last when the revolutions and wars end. That is the price modern
man pays for the eclipse of the sacred dimension. When he dethroned the ideas of
soul and God he was thrown back hopelessly on his own resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-immortality-project&quot;&gt;The Immortality Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a
symbolic self, we are able to transcend the dilemma of mortality through
heroism, by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;immortality project&amp;quot;
(or &amp;quot;causa sui project&amp;quot;), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that
ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality. By successfully living
under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic
and, henceforth, part of something eternal; something that will never die as
compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that
their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arbitrariness of human-invented immortality projects makes them naturally
prone to conflict. When one immortality project conflicts with another, it is
essentially an accusation of &amp;#39;wrongness of life&amp;#39;, and so sets the context for
both aggressive and defensive behavior. Each party will want to prove its belief
system is superior, a better way of life. Thus these immortality projects are
considered a fundamental driver of human conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;anxiety-fear-of-death-and-illusions&quot;&gt;Anxiety, Fear of Death and Illusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature fear and anxiousness improve survival, hence today we still are
anxious, even though the environment does not justify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man works against his fragility by seeking living experiences, moving towards
more life. Or he plunges in self-absorbing activities. Fear of death can be
ignored and sometimes absorbed into the life-expanding process: this is called
&lt;em&gt;repression&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can people stand the really demonic activity of working behind those hellish
ranges in hotel kitchens, the frantic whirl of waiting on a dozen tables at one
time, the madness of the travel agent’s office at the height of the tourist
season, or the torture of working with a jack-hammer all day on a hot summer
street. The answer is that the craziness of these activities is exactly that of
the human condition. They are &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; us because the alternative is natural
desperation. The daily madness of these jobs is a repeated vaccination against
the madness of the asylum. Look at the joy and eagerness with which workers
return from vacation to their compulsive routines. They plunge into their work
with equanimity and lightheartedness because it drowns out something more
ominous. Men have to be protected from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which poses another gigantic problem to a sophisticated Marxism (or universal
basic income): What is the nature of the obsessive denials of reality that a
Utopian society will provide to keep men from going mad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the awareness of mortality dawns beyond the frenetic activity, it emerges in pure
form. Things like psychotic break can issue when repression is no longer possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man is horrified by his own basic animal condition, a condition that, especially
as a child, he cannot understand and that, as an adult, he cannot accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a need for illusion — without being cynical. There is a great deal of
falseness and self-deception in the cultural immortality project, but there is
also the necessity of this project. Man needs a second world, a world of humanly
created meaning, a new reality that he can live, dramatize, nourish himself in.
We need new convincing illusions that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are
agreeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becker does not provide any definitive answer as to what these illusions might
be, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he
hopes that gradual realization of humanity&amp;#39;s innate motivations, namely death,
can help to bring about a better world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sex-love-and-the-body&quot;&gt;Sex, Love and the Body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to have sex without guilt: the body casts a shadow on the
person&amp;#39;s inner freedom / real self that — through sex — is being forced into a
standardized, mechanical, biological role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love lets us feel that the other person recognizes and respects or
symbolic self even as they see us at our most animalistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body is the clear problem over which he must triumph in order to build a
cultural personality at all, as it is the clear enemy in establishing our
divinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;character-and-reality&quot;&gt;Character and Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character is a neurotic defense against despair, and shedding character means
risking death and madness. To see reality, one must die and be reborn, which
means shedding character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kierkegaard: it&amp;#39;s good to open toward new possibility and choice, to be able to
face anxiety. To be closed is evil, it means shutting out revelations and giving
up on reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depressed person avoids the possibility of independence and more life
precisely because these are what threaten him with destruction and death. He
holds on to the people who have enslaved him in a network of crushing
obligations, belittling interaction, precisely because these people are his
shelter, his strength, his protection against the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the prison of one&amp;#39;s character one can pretend and feel that he is somebody,
that the world is manageable, that there is a reason for one&amp;#39;s life, a ready
justification for one&amp;#39;s action. To live automatically and uncritically is to be
assured of at least a minimum share of the programmed cultural heroics — what we
might call &amp;quot;prison heroism&amp;quot; — feeling like an insider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;authority-delegated-power&quot;&gt;Authority &amp;amp; Delegated Power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you admit that you are a creature, you accomplish one basic thing: you
demolish all your unconscious power linkages or supports. Each child grounds
himself in some power that transcends him. Usually it is a combination of his
parents, his social group, and the symbols of his society and nation. This is
the unthinking web of support which allows him to believe in himself, as he
functions on the automatic security of delegated powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man has &amp;quot;an extreme passion for authority&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wishes to be governed by
unrestricted force&amp;quot;. People have &amp;quot;a longing to be hypnotized&amp;quot; by a leader
because they want to get back the magical protection and feeling of
belongingness that they enjoyed from their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leader is a creature of the group, as are his followers. The leader has no
more freedom to be himself, as he has to be a reflex of the group. The followers
give in the leader&amp;#39;s commands but can always retain the feeling that these
commands are alien to them — the leader&amp;#39;s responsibility. This can make people
guiltless, as they can imagine themselves temporary victims of the leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man uses morality to get to a place of belongingness and perpetuation in the
universe. By conforming to the rules made by representatives of natural power
(leaders), his safe belongingness is assured. This is natural: we tell the child
when he is good so that he doesn’t have to be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first way in which man attempts to overcome his own finitude and
unimportance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;heroic-gifts&quot;&gt;Heroic Gifts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second way man attmepts to overcome his own finitude is by developing a
really valuable heroic gift, becoming extra-special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are the average man you give your heroic gift to the society in which you
live, and you give the gift that society specifies in advance. If you are an
artist you fashion a peculiarly personal gift, the justification of your own
heroic identity, which means that it is always aimed at least partly over the
heads of your fellow men. After all, they can’t grant the immortality of your
personal soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social hero-system into which we are born marks out paths for our heroism,
paths to which we conform, to which we shape ourselves so that we can please
others, become what they expect us to be. And instead of working our inner
secret we gradually cover it over and forget it, while we become purely external
men, playing successfully the standardized hero-game into which we happen to
fall by accident, by family connection, by reflex patriotism, or by the simple
need to eat and the urge to procreate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real problem of man: to find his true talent, his secret gift, his
authentic vocation. This question may become so intolerable as to cause suicide
and flight in the rush of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person spends years coming into his own, developing his talent, his unique
gifts, perfecting his discriminations about the world, broadening and sharpening
his appetite, learning to bear the disappointments of life, becoming mature,
seasoned—finally a unique creature in nature, standing with some dignity and
nobility and transcending the animal condition; no longer driven, no longer a
complete reflex, not stamped out of any mold. And then the real tragedy, as
André Malraux wrote in The Human Condition: that it takes sixty years of
incredible suffering and effort to make such an individual, and then he is good
only for dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;repression-and-partialization&quot;&gt;Repression and Partialization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great lesson of Freudian psychology: that repression is normal
self-protection and creative self-restriction—in a real sense, man’s natural
substitute for instinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is impossible without &lt;em&gt;partialization&lt;/em&gt;. What we call the well-adjusted man
has just this capacity to partialize the world for comfortable action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partializing the world is biting off what an animal can chew. Not to have this
talent means constantly biting off more than one can chew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the artist so often avoid clinical neurosis, when he is so much a
candidate for it because of his vivid imagination, his openness to the finest
and broadest aspects of experience, his isolation from the cultural world-view
that satisfies everyone else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that he takes in the world, but instead of being oppressed by it
he reworks it in his own personality and recreates it in the work of art. The
neurotic is precisely the one who cannot create — the &amp;quot;artiste-manqué&amp;quot;. We might
say that both the artist and the neurotic bite off more than they can chew, but
the artist spews it back out again and chews it over in an objectified way, as
an external, active, work project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Research: A Personal Perspective</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Even though it&amp;#39;s what I spend most of my time on, I don&amp;#39;t often post about my
research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is that I am still a perfectionnist and I feel bad about
posting something which isn&amp;#39;t as complete as I&amp;#39;d like it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that, supposedly, communicating about your ongoing research is supposed
to be beneficial. Frankly, I have yet to see evidence of that, beyond the
benefit of organizing your thoughts. It might just be that my field (parsing) is
quite small, and everyone is busy on his own thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second issue is that my research project has evolved quite a bit over the
years, as has the way I came to evaluate my research results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, today I want to do a quick tour of all my research so far. This will
include some (very high-level) technical details as well as my unfiltered
feelings on my work. It will be fairly intermingled, but feel free to skip what
doesn&amp;#39;t interest you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually started a PhD in networking; the topic was improving Software Defined
Networks (SDN). Over the course of a year, I grew disillusioned with SDN and
realized the difficulties to do practical research on that topic. I&amp;#39;m not saying
the field is bogus at all, there is very high quality research there — but
clearly the field wasn&amp;#39;t well matched to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point I had gotten a scholarship from the national science foundation,
and so my next move was to switch my topic and my adviser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really wanted to do was experiment with programming language design. To
do this I had a grandiose, over-ambitious idea that was both a language feature
in its own right, and a way to enable cheap experimentation with language design
later down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal was to make a truly extensible language. The details were of course not
hammered out, but you can think about it as taking macro a step further, to
enable not only local changes, but global program transformations. These
transformations had to compose gracefully, and work within a typed language too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people warned me about the over-ambitious part, and I knew they were right.
Nevertheless, that idea was kind of the &amp;quot;true north&amp;quot; that would guide my
research direction. So I starting on my path, with the first thing I needed: a
parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motiviation to rolling my own parser was that the grammar of the language
would have to change dynamically, depending on included extensions. It seemed
like an important piece of infrastructure to get full control on, and I had
written my own parser before... how hard could this be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in the end my thesis only focuses on parsing, so it looks like it was
rather hard after all :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of this post, let me walk you through the various papers I wrote
and projects I undertook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;-sdload-an-extensible-framework-for-sdn-workload-generation-&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;SDLoad: An Extensible Framework for SDN Workload Generation&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://norswap.com/pubs/hotsdn2014.pdf&quot;&gt;🔗 link to paper (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually an extended abstract I made while I was still working on
networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, this was a framework to generate &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; — graph of objects
really. I built it from scratch and then employed it to generate descriptions of
SDN workload (so basically a sequence of network events).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation is random, modulo constraints that the user can supply, either as
filtering code, or as custom generators. It was also possible to define and use
different statistical distribution, assign weights to certain events, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation approach is not novel at all, as are all things so general and
abstract. The goal was not actually to make a great contribution, but rather to
build a tool to would have been useful later in my thesis (as planned at the
time) and maybe even to other researcher. Well, that didn&amp;#39;t really pan out,
albeit it might have been used in some later research project (I&amp;#39;m not sure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the idea of generating inputs stayed with me, and I now use it
regularly to do testing, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://norswap.com/gen-testing/&quot;&gt;described in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;-parsing-expression-grammars-made-practical-&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Parsing Expression Grammars Made Practical&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://norswap.com/pubs/sle2015.pdf&quot;&gt;🔗 link to paper (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first paper I wrote after switching my topic, and I wrote it rather
quickly (in about three months). I got a big surge of initial motivation from
this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the paper, which was submitted as a &amp;quot;tool paper&amp;quot; presents a parsing
framework based on &lt;em&gt;Parsing Expression Grammars&lt;/em&gt; (PEG), a relatively recent grammar
formalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in my PhD I would come to dismiss this paper as &amp;quot;not really much&amp;quot;, but now
I have newfound appreciation for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper basically has three contributions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It presents a general algorithm to allow left-recursion in PEG grammars,
something that the formalism doesn&amp;#39;t normally allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It presents a modification of that algorithm that enables to handle
precedence and associativity, given that grammar rules have been properly
annotated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shows how to customize different aspects of the parse process with
arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contribution 1, arguably the most intersting to someone reading the paper, is
actually 95% work from Chris Seaton in his master thesis (something I made
super clear in the paper). But burried in his master thesis, the technique had
never received the exposure it deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contribution 3 is the start of a theme that would continue throughout my thesis:
the fact that if the execution model is defined precisely enough, it becomes
easier to extend with new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I think the value in the paper is not where it pretends to be. The
tool has little importance, more intersting are the techniques I used, that
could be reused in other tools. Having a paper that explains how you can do
left-recursion and explicit precedence and associativity with PEG — that&amp;#39;s
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the paper is not as readily findable as I would have wished. I
have come to rue its name, which is both cocky and not very informative on the
content of the paper. I probably should take the time to link that paper from a
few places of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;-taming-context-sensitive-languages-with-principled-stateful-parsing-&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Taming Context-Sensitive Languages with Principled Stateful Parsing&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://norswap.com/pubs/sle2016.pdf&quot;&gt;🔗 link to paper (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper grew out of the first one rather opportunistically. Basically I
noticed a pattern in how I dealth with various kind of &amp;quot;state&amp;quot; within my parser
when backtracking (input position, tables, ...). The idea was then to generalize
that to any kind of user-defined state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having user-defined state that can guide the parse is rather useful, as it
turns. It can be used to express grammars that feature &lt;em&gt;context-sensitivity&lt;/em&gt;,
something parsers don&amp;#39;t normally allow. Explaining context-sensitivity is rather
hard, but the simplest example is probably the issue of recall: recalling some
piece of input later. For instance in XML, opening and closing tags have to
match: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is valid but not &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/z&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the paper basically explains how you can have state in your parser, in a way
that is safe despite the presence of backtracking. I also provided an
implementation of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper has probably been my major research effort so far, although I have
good hopes that it will be topped by what I&amp;#39;m working on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, this took me a good year of work. Its first incarnation was submitted
at OOPSLA in Jan. 2016, then reworked and submitted (and subsequently accepted)
at SLE in June 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is good and useful research. In the end, the solution is almost
disappointingly simple; but it didn&amp;#39;t start out simple, it took me great pains
to get there. Someone smarter than me, or at least more mindful of his work,
would probably have completed this much faster than me, but in the end I am not
disappointed with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem with this paper lays on another dimension: that of strategy and
carreer development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem that this approach solves is real, and yet it is tiny at the same
time. Most languages are 99+ % not context-sensitive, but the context-sensitive
parts will really annoy the hell of you when you get to it. Most often this is
worked around with various hacks, and — you know what — most of the time this is
good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that mean we shouldn&amp;#39;t have a principled solution? Of course not. It just
means it&amp;#39;s a solution to a minor problem instead of a major one. Frankly,
expecting to come up with major work a few months after entering a field might
be a sign of unbridled hubris on my parts — but I&amp;#39;m just relating how feel (or
at least felt for a long time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is then: did I have better alternatives? I&amp;#39;m not sure, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;uranium-semantic-analysis&quot;&gt;Uranium &amp;amp; Semantic Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting to the next published paper, let&amp;#39;s actually get to the project
that occupied the intervening year, but didn&amp;#39;t actually lead to any publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, it was quite clear I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to develop even a
significant part of the extensible language during my thesis. My plan was to
reframe the thesis&amp;#39; objective as &amp;quot;improving compiler toolchains&amp;quot;, with the idea
that this might eventually help bring about the extensible language, or really
anything language-related I wanted to experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that year, I worked on a framework dubbed &lt;em&gt;Uranium&lt;/em&gt; that would make it
easier to write the semantic analysis stage of a compiler. Semantic analysis is
notably what takes care of name resolution (associating identifiers and
declarations) and typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uranium ended up looking a lot like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_grammar&quot;&gt;attribute grammars&lt;/a&gt;: a way to derive the
values of attributes associated with AST nodes. Besides shedding the historical
baggage (which could be considered a good or a bad thing), the framework also
took inspiration for the classical type system formal notation, which makes use
of inference rules. In line with the rest of my work, these rules were going to
be written using arbitrary code, in order to enable maximum flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the way of it is that you define inference rules that derive the
values of attributes given the availability of some other attributes, and the
framework was going to order all this stuff for you. It works in a bottom-up
manner, trying to derive all attributes, instead of the top-down manner that
characterize most attribute grammar implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework itself ended up being rather simple, both in concepts and
implementation. I used the Java language as a use case, to try out if I could
express non-trivial semantics using it. And this is where the problems begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java is a big language, with a lot of edge cases and ambiguities. But it is by
no means alone — I think the same can be said of almost every language that we
can qualify as &amp;quot;mainstream&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some difficulties I ran into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was too ambitious. I wanted the framework to be fully incremental, meaning
it could start deriving meaning even with missing information (~declarations),
and could react to updated information. This added a lot of complexity while I
was still early in the design stage. I ended up getting rid of that
requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to take care of location and loading Java classes: I did not just look
at source files and assume the program did not use any standard library. While
I think it is miles easier in Java than in, say, C or C++, it still was a
non-trivial implementation effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to resolve identifier chains. First, you have to disambiguate what
is a value, what is a class, and what is a package. For instance, let&amp;#39;s assume
we have determined that &lt;code&gt;java.util.List&lt;/code&gt; refers to a type; &lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt; could be
either a class or part of a package name. The Java rule is that if &lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt; can
be resolved to a class, the whole chain will be resolved assuming that (and
potentially fail). In order to know whether &lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt; is a class, you need to
know all the classes in the current package, the local classes, as well as all
the system classes that are available by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to their inherent ambiguity, identifier chains also posed problems
in their interactions with the framework. The right way to model identifier
chains is to make the resolution of each element in the chain dependent on the
previous element. However, I had represented identifier chains as a single AST
node holding a list, so instead I relied on a concept of &lt;em&gt;continuation&lt;/em&gt;: an
inference rule could report that it needed more information to proceed, and
the framework would re-try the rule once the information became available. An
identifier chain would emit one such continuation (one at a time) per
identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the lesson was that the effort to implement the inference rules and
the surrounding support infrastructure for a single language dwarfed the effort
of building the inference framework. It&amp;#39;s a bit hard to sell an improvement that
only saves you 10% of the effort. With the approach being novel, it probably
could have flied; but with attribute grammars looming in the background, no
dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you, an idea, in addition to just the rules, the Java system needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Model of source elements (essentially more precise version of the AST nodes,
which could also hold extra information, for instance related to name
resolution). These models needed to come in three flavours, because there are
three ways to acquire the information of a class: through a source file,
through a bytecode class, or through reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a scope tree to represent lexical scoping and determine which
declarations where visible where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fairly precise typing hierarchies and sub/supertyping algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class location and loading mechanism already discussed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a lot! In comparison the framework was minimal in complexity and the only
big change that it needed was the addition of the &lt;em&gt;continuation&lt;/em&gt; concept
mentionned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that it was hard to migrate complexity from the Java
implementation into the framework, because the framework was supposed to be
agnostic about the language it was used to implement. For instance, I could have
implemented utilities that made typing much easier to implement... but then I
would have had to tie to framework to a certain idea of how typing is supposed
to work. That approach is more in line with how language workbenches (like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;Spoofax&lt;/a&gt;) work, and there is nothing wrong with that, it&amp;#39;s just not what I was
trying to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ultimately faced with the prospect of continuing to pour work into a
hard-to-sell blackhole of a use-case, I decided to write off the project and
pivot onto something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure is still fresh, and so my outlook might not yet be good enough.
Nevertheless, I think that the mistake I made in this case was badly
overestimating the problem, as well as misunderstanding its nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did look at some semantic analysis code, and I saw these big tangled messes.
My conclusion was that there should be a simpler, more structured way to go
about things. However I failed to consider that the problem might have been a
matter of &lt;em&gt;programming in the small&lt;/em&gt;: that some refactoring as well as good
documentation could have helped tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also wasn&amp;#39;t really clear to me what part of the complexity
was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet&quot;&gt;intrinsic&lt;/a&gt; and which part was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet&quot;&gt;accidental&lt;/a&gt;: I think I
overestimated the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could have have done to seize up the problem better? Probably try to write
semantic analysis code without any framework, to get an intuitive sense of where
the issues lay. This is something I had done for parsing (writing a parser by
hand), although my purpose at the time was not to learn about the difficulties
in parsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;red-shift-procedural-shift-reduce-parsing&quot;&gt;Red Shift: Procedural Shift-Reduce Parsing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://norswap.com/pubs/sle2017.pdf&quot;&gt;🔗 link to paper (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially wanted to publish something about Uranium at SLE 2017, but clearly
that was not going to fly. As I re-read the call for paper, I noticed that this
year they were accepting 4-page &amp;quot;vision papers&amp;quot; that outlined a vision for an
early stage idea. That was for me the opportunity to revisit an idle thought I
had during the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was about finding the converse of &lt;acronym=&quot;Parsing Expression
Grammars&quot;&gt;PEGs&lt;/acronym&gt; for bottom-up parsing. PEGs can be seen as a
formalization of the way people naturally write top-down parsers by hand. So how
did people write bottom-up parsers by hand, and how could I formalize or package
that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I found very little about hand-written bottom-up parsers, yet I
saw how it could make sense. The paper is precisely about that: how to write
bottom-up parsers by hand, and the potential benefits of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namely, in the approach I envisionned, there were two big benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parser was permissive and so would parse as much as possible, even in the
presence of errors. The trick is that the parser recognizes low-level
structures first, and builds them up into higher-level structures (e.g. from
literals to expressions to statements to functions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would enable better error reporting, as the partial structures we build up
during the parse could be used to provide context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cranked the paper out in less than two weeks, also building a small prototype
to confirm my ideas were not completely out of whack. To paraphrase a well-known
mass-murderer: &amp;quot;There are years where nothing happens; and there are weeks where
years happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-m-doing-now&quot;&gt;What I&amp;#39;m Doing Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last paper was the inflexion point I needed to pivot away from the Uranium
project. Instead, I launched into what I&amp;#39;m currently doing, which is build up
this idea into a proper framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My handmade bottom-up parsers made use of &lt;em&gt;reducers&lt;/em&gt;: bits of code that look 
at the parse stack and perform a reduction if some condition holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that said conditions were almost always equivalent to performing a
regular expression match over the tokens and AST nodes on the parse stack.
Hence, my first step was to built a library (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/skelex&quot;&gt;skelex&lt;/a&gt;) to perform that part of
the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part will be to build the framework proper, which orchestrates the
regular expression matching and the nodes reductions. I&amp;#39;m still working on the
design, so there is not much I can say right now, but stay tuned :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently released &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/skelex&quot;&gt;skelex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a regular expression (regex) matching library that
works over streams of objects. Unlike most regex libraries, it also produces a

      <title>TSR&#39;s Series on Celerity — A Summary</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestrategicreview.net/&quot;&gt;The Strategic Review&lt;/a&gt; Series on Celerity is
an eleven-parts mailing list series written
by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sebastianmarshall.com/&quot;&gt;Sebastian Marshall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject is &lt;em&gt;celerity&lt;/em&gt;, roughly speed as a trait of character: &lt;em&gt;moving fast&lt;/em&gt;
as in business, not necessarly as in a race. The series explains what celerity
is and how to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the titles of the ten parts (parenthesized annotations are mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#01-frenzied-genius-suppression-&quot;&gt;Frenzied Genius (Suppression)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#10-speed-of-execution-project-selection-&quot;&gt;Speed of Execution (Project Selection)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#11-effectiveness-first&quot;&gt;Effectiveness First&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series is full of interesting insights tied around a common purpose, and I
thought it was important enough to deserve a one-page summary. I still encourage
you to read the original, especially for the vivid historical comparisons that I
often had to cut for the sake of brevity. I&amp;#39;ve put a link to the original at the
start of the summary for each issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celerity is as much a character trait as it as actual speed. Some people are
regularly able to do things much more quickly than others, and those people tend
– unsurprisingly – to get a lot more done in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages to Celerity are fairly straightforward – there&amp;#39;s many things in
life that are worth doing. By accomplishing them faster, you can do more of what
matters to you. Even when you have things that aren&amp;#39;t particularly meaningful
but which you&amp;#39;re somewhat stuck doing (admin, paperwork, taxes) – getting them
done as quickly as possible frees you back up to get on with what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you analyze where speed actually comes from, it usually isn&amp;#39;t just trying
harder to &amp;quot;go faster&amp;quot; – the Mongol horse archers, for instance, typically rode
with 3-4 horses per soldier. Their famous speed didn&amp;#39;t come from whipping the
horses to ride harder and having them break down, but from changing horses
regularly on the journey and traveling light with very little supplies needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to gain celerity – to become fast-as-a-character-trait – is often about
small variables and far-upstream decisions that often might not seem to relate
much to speed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be a little counterintuitive. You can&amp;#39;t just will &amp;quot;I want to go faster&amp;quot; –
without the relevant design, infrastructure, and thinking that allows you to go
faster. Of course, this makes perfect sense when you think it through, write it
down, and read it – but most people don&amp;#39;t think it through, write it down, or
read it; most people also don&amp;#39;t go very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultivation of celerity isn&amp;#39;t raw speed. Hastening your way to a loss is not
celerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is a marvelous and amazing place – there&amp;#39;s so many things worth doing.
Building speed into your thinking and character is worthwhile – it can then be
flexibly deployed into getting whatever you want. But first and foremost, you
have to figure out what&amp;#39;s worth moving fast towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;01-frenzied-genius-suppression-&quot;&gt;01. Frenzied Genius (Suppression)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=6b601ddd13ae676e0c4d8b6a2&amp;amp;id=84efa10a86&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impulse or impetus – the arising of an urge or cue to go do things. We&amp;#39;re
feeling these all the time. There&amp;#39;s hunger, or the need to go to the bathroom;
likewise, remembering an old friend out of the blue and wanting to write them a
note, or remembering some recent event and wanting to learn the facts of it –
like who won the recent Dutch election?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppression or control effect – the overriding or contextualizing of an impulse
or behavior we desire to do. We put diapers on very small children because they
can&amp;#39;t suppress the desire to discharge their bowels after feeling that impulse.
Likewise, concentration involves suppressing urges to look up who won the recent
Dutch election if we&amp;#39;re doing important work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] One hears – one does not seek; one takes--one does not ask who gives: a thought
suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes with necessity, unhesitatingly – &lt;em&gt;I
have never had any choice in the matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote illustrates something close to maximum anti-suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right amount of personal suppression is a tricky thing. Nietzsche had strong
opinions on this, talking about how art, at its best, involved a blend of the
influences of the gods Apollo and Dionysus – Apollo being law, order, and
control; Dionysus being chaos, disorder, liberation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the precise right amount of suppression is tricky. An inability to make
unique or new works of art, to evaluate and weigh the merits of controversial
ideas – heck, an inability to take social or interpersonal risks come as a
result of suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we procrastinate, it can come from either side of impulse and suppression –
it might be that we have impulses that we fail to suppress; or it might be that
we feel a generalized weight against doing whatever action occurs to us, and we
don&amp;#39;t follow it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reputation and punishments increase suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelling, intoxicants (alcohol), ill health and near death experiences
decrease suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche went frenzied notably because he ruined his reputation, travelled
constantly, used opium heavily and had a very poor health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche&amp;#39;s ability to produce an immense amount in a frenzied manic genius only
was possible because he built a huge background of knowledge and skill – he had
10-15 years of constant and diligent thinking and scholarship before he flipped
the switch and began to act in a more frenzied way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Nietzsche had been max-anti-suppression from the age of 14, he would have
accomplished &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be natural to ask if it was worth it, but who cares? Most of us won&amp;#39;t
choose Nietzsche&amp;#39;s path. He broke down mentally at only 44 years old. There are
many diagnoses, but there is no doubt that the way he lived must have
exacerbated the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche wrote the frist draft of &amp;quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&amp;quot; in 10 days. In 10
days, Nietzsche wrote one of the most important 100 pages in modern history.
Most people won&amp;#39;t ever have a run of 10 days like those. Who has? Winston
Churchill? Mustafa Kemal? But these are war leaders. Who, in peace, has 10 days
like Nietzsche&amp;#39;s best 10 days? These 10 days were hundreds of time more
productive than 10 solid productive days for most people. And yet the cost is
too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#39;s somewhat abstract and the exact patterns of implementation are very
personal, &lt;u&gt;thinking through what mix of suppression is in your life long-term
(culture, society, reputation) and short-term (habits, consumption, intoxicants,
training, sleep schedules, behavior, escapism) can easily unlock 3%, 5%,
10%, or much higher gains on a regular basis.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;02-power-laws-exponential-growth-&quot;&gt;02. Power Laws (Exponential Growth)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=6b601ddd13ae676e0c4d8b6a2&amp;amp;id=88438f54c4&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compound interest is an exponential growth rate, not a fixed linear amount of
growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exponential growth rates can be a lot better, but humans are bad at naturally
understanding them. The human brain, it seems, is just not well-primed to
understand how exponential growth diverges so heavily from linear growth. If you
get 10% on $100, you get $159.37 in 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s better – it&amp;#39;s, well, it&amp;#39;s 59% higher. But it&amp;#39;s not shockingly better in
absolute terms; the brain naturally tends to fail to notice the huge tidal wave
of gains that&amp;#39;s about to hit. In 20 years, the fixed growth gets +$200; the
compounded growth gets +$572.75… and it keeps growing. 30 years is +$300 or
+$1644.94.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe compound interest is boring to people because 20 or 30 years seems like a
long time. But the thing is, compounding exponential gains can happen on any
timeframe – in startups, Paul Graham advocates for looking for compound business
growth on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norswap&amp;#39;s note: If you grow at X% per time unit, it will take you ~70/X time
units to double your capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead you had a new business making $100 per week (which is a measly $5200
per year), and you grew your revenues 10% per week, you&amp;#39;d make only $110 in week
two… but at week 31, you&amp;#39;d be making $1744.94 per week – or over $90,000 per
year. In just 30 weeks. That&amp;#39;s pretty exciting. Most of us can get excited about
that kind of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three forces are arrayed against long-term compounding exponential growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrying capacity&lt;/strong&gt;: at some point, everyone in the whole world will own an
iPhone and every city will have a lot of Starbucks locations, and then growth
will slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operations and scaling&lt;/strong&gt;: things seem to get harder to manage, or at
least different, as they get bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;#39;t search out for exponential growth opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just that if you want to succeed in some domain, you have to
understand the forces driving it. Understanding growth is what starting a
startup consists of. What you&amp;#39;re really doing (and to the dismay of some
observers, all you&amp;#39;re really doing) when you start a startup is committing to
solve a harder type of problem than ordinary businesses do. You&amp;#39;re committing
to search for one of the rare ideas that generates rapid growth. Because these
ideas are so valuable, finding one is hard. The startup is the embodiment of
your discoveries so far. Starting a startup is thus very much like deciding to
be a research scientist: you&amp;#39;re not committing to solve any specific problem;
you don&amp;#39;t know for sure which problems are soluble; but you&amp;#39;re committing to
try to discover something no one knew before. A startup founder is in effect
an economic research scientist. Most don&amp;#39;t discover anything that remarkable,
but some discover relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Paul Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard Schultz (Starbucks) saw an opportunity for premium-priced coffee in nice
locations, and saw that it was largely unfilled. As soon as he realized that his
stores were profitable, he raced to expand Starbucks at the fastest rate that he
could without having operations and management break down. He succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the game right here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic math&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic logic and thinking-through implications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant testing and experimenting to search for exponential growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2g99bQw&quot;&gt;Traction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has some great practical guides on how to do it in
entrepreneurship, and just about all of &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2g99bQw&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&amp;#39;s essays&lt;/a&gt; are worth reading –
these are good starting points to start thinking about it more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=6b601ddd13ae676e0c4d8b6a2&amp;amp;id=52ccee734c&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue explores the difference between taking an attrition approach or a
maneuver approach – both in warfare, and in general life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attrition is wearing down an opponent or a challenge through sheer and repeated
force: &amp;quot;charging the machine guns&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maneuver warfare is slightly less straightforward – it involves assessing
critical points in the enemy and reaching those at the lowest possible cost
using speed, surprise, and innovation. The general idea is go around the most
heavily defended points of the enemy and strike as what&amp;#39;s vulnerable – if
successful, this comes at much lower cost and much greater efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory is straightforward. Go around the machine guns instead of charging
the machine guns. The practice is much harder, for two reasons –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept seems unnatural and unintuitive to humans. Overwhelmingly, the
first instinct and response of humans to problems seems to be to charge them
head on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s often very straightforward how to fight along established lines and
conventions, whereas it&amp;#39;s almost always non-obvious how to successfully
maneuver around strong points effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue focuses on the first problem: the concept seems unnatural. Further
issues (in particular 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9) will expound on the factors that make or
break the maneuver approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the errors of attrition warfare can be attributed to two in-built flaws
typical to humans – fixation and sunk cost effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixation&lt;/strong&gt; is becoming obsessed with a particular thing. Exemple: During the
Gettysburg battle, general Robert E. Lee believed he was close to a victory (by
the third day, he wasn&amp;#39;t) and that he needed a victory there (he didn&amp;#39;t). He
thus turned a minor loss into a very bad loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A counter example for fixation: During the second Punic War, Roman general
Scipio Africanus ignored Hannibal entirely and focused on weaker commanders in
Carthage&amp;#39;s power base in Spain, and then invaded North Africa and launched some
very effective surprise raids against Carthage. The Romans never beat Hannibal
in the field in Italy, but he was recalled and had to leave Italy by maneuvering
around his local superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunk costs&lt;/strong&gt; magnify the effects – during WW2, both the Allied naval assault
and amphibious landings at Gallipoli had a chance to succeed when they were
launched with speed and surprise, but after the Ottoman Turks had defended the
initial assaults, the Allies and British in particular became very concerned
about &amp;quot;prestige&amp;quot; – thus they kept reinforcing an objectively terrible position
with more and more troops, slowly pouring units into Gallipoli in terrible
unsanitary positions, overlooked by well-defended Turkish positions. Eventually,
they left Gallipoli not with a minor defeat, but with one of the worst defeats
in British history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious thing to do in most situations is the obvious thing – but the
obvious thing is also often the most expensive in terms of material resources
and psychology. The victories in such situations are the most expensive and
exhausting – Pyrrhic victories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human tendency is to attrition-away at problems, both in military operations
and in everyday life. The temptation is to see a large problem and go right
after it, fixating on it, and thus being denied the potential to see more
creative and less expensive ways around and through the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunk cost effects multiply the problems – once failure starts to set in, human
nature is often to throw more and more force after it, turning small defeats
into outright catastrophes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these, of course, are devastating to celerity – speed is not achieved by
focusing on an intractable and brutally expensive problem and attritioning away
at it forever; it&amp;#39;s achieved by spotting more cost-effective and innovative ways
around problems to get at gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;04-cohesion&quot;&gt;04. Cohesion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=6b601ddd13ae676e0c4d8b6a2&amp;amp;id=3d65015952&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why have so many wars throughout history bogged down into attrition warfare?
After all, the long historical record has shown maneuver-oriented commanders to
be much more successful (e.g. Hannibal, Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte).
Meanwhile, attrition warfare always came at exceedingly high cost even in
victory, and often led even the stronger side to horrific defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partially this can be attributed to human nature – as discussed last issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet... often, there would be voices of insight and innovation within a camp
that would nevertheless up taking a disastrous approach. The challenge is,
holding firm to a non-obvious plan is hard to do when human factors get in the
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain the gains and advantages of speed through creativity and unorthodox
approaches, you need &lt;strong&gt;cohesion&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make a genuinely innovative plan succeed, there are a number of
factors you need – the first we could call sociotechnical alignment, meaning
having people, technology, and resources work effectively together. This will be
discussed in the next issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once you understand your capabilities and are well-trained in them, a few
more things are required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit cohesion: the ability for multiple people to execute together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed, especially around windows of opportunity (cf. issue 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cohesion: getting every element of strategy, timing, people, technology,
goals, and leadership working together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two historical examples: Germany&amp;#39;s Schleiffen Plan during WW1, and the British
assault on Gallipoli during WW2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Schleiffen Plan called for the germans to fight defensively, with minimal
forces, against the Russians on the eastern front. The goal was to deploy almost
all their forces against France on the western front, and knock it out of the
war as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Schleiffen Plan had called for both sacrifice and surprise. Sacrifice, in
that the Russians would have been able to do a lot of damage in the east as the
price for pouring all of the German Empire&amp;#39;s soldiers into France. This is also
precisely why it would be surprising. But general Moltke couldn&amp;#39;t do it; or at
least, didn&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British made similar errors at Gallipoli. The high command had been willing
to sacrifice up to a dozen obsolete warships to knock the Ottoman Empire out of
the war. But the Admiral leading the attack was not fully onboard with the plan;
he was unwilling to sacrifice the ships. In the end, half of the ships were lost
and the Ottoman Empire was still in the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British followed up the mistake by landing not-enough troops on the
Gallipoli Peninsula. It was enough soldiers to lose in a drawn-out and brutal
fashion, not enough to break through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that this, too, becomes a sort of fixation. The Schleiffen Plan and the
Gallipoli Naval Operations were both innovative maneuver-oriented plans. They
were surprising and audacious. Neither plan was committed to enough to succeed,
due to different incentives and indecision. As such, both plans were run
uncohesively and led to disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a bunch of political stakeholders have different personal goals, and
different traditions and preferences, plans get butchered and halfway-ran, which
is often worse than running no plan at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;#39;re working solo on your endeavors, there&amp;#39;s no doubt that we often
get conflicted within ourselves – a desire for making large gains on one hand,
for instance, and for not looking stupid on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;No matter how innovative or good your plans are, it&amp;#39;s essential to be fully
committed in the execution in them, and to have provisioned enough resources to
them.&lt;/u&gt; This requires having all the people involved getting on the same page, and
making require sacrifices. There&amp;#39;s often major breakthroughs possible – but it&amp;#39;s
often not possible to make major breakthroughs simultaneously with doing a dozen
other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;05-sociotechnical-alignment&quot;&gt;05. Sociotechnical Alignment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=6b601ddd13ae676e0c4d8b6a2&amp;amp;id=e314c0b65e&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WW2, the first big initial innovation was the breach-loading rifle. It was
easier to reload, even when prone, and became cheap to produce due to the
industrial revolution. This means soldier could be trained in a matter of days,
resulting in a large amount of soldiers available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second big innovation was more low key: it was the barbed wire. It
completely stopped cavalry charges in war, and it took infantrymen a substantial
amount of time to navigate it safely. Barbed wire in front of a trench, guarded
by men with breach-loading rifles, was nearly impossible to approach with any
chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever side was attacking was, almost without fail, going to take more
losses. Unlike the old times, taking a fortified position meant little: the
ennemy could build one just like it a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides went on to develop two very different innovations to deal with
this new reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Germans went on to develop modern infiltration tactics. For this, they
trained shock troopers equipped with a large number of grenades to overwhelm the
ennemy, often after an artillery barrage. It was also possible to avoid strong
points to pass behind ennemy lines, then navigate to the position where it was
possible to do the most damage. Afterwards, conventional troops could clean up
isolated pockets of ennemy forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allies, on the other hand, developped the tank to break through trenches.
Sebastian speculates it would have gone on to win the war had the armistice not
been signed. On the other hand, German innovation had come close to breaking the
front in the late stages of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Germans developped a soft technology, the allies a hard one. Hard
technologies are material innovations, while soft technologies are systems,
hierarchies, processes, management methods. Typically, the second is overlooked
in favour of the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the largest opportunities and the largest perils in any era come from
technological evolution – both hard technologies and soft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When technology improves, it seems like the default human reaction is to try to
do whatever happened in the past in a stronger and bigger way using the new
technology. Indeed, the initial movements of World War I looked something like a
larger and more destructive high-technology version of the Napoleonic Wars from
100 years previous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sociotechnical systems in organizational development is an approach to complex
organizational work design that recognizes the interaction between people and
technology in workplaces. […] sociotechnical theory is about joint
optimization, that is, designing the social system and technical system in
tandem so that they work smoothly together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;u&gt;sociotechnical alignment is all about making hard and soft
technologies work in tandem&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To navigate any situation well, you need to discern the universal principles
that apply, as well as what specifics have recently changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting up sociotechnical systems, there are two things you should look out
for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When something that was formerly expensive becomes inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When something that formerly required high skill to accomplish can later be
achieved with low or no skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&amp;#39;t stop there, though – you should next ask yourself what soft
technologies and different objectives would pair with the now-cheaper hard
technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting into alignment as such is where a lot of celerity comes from – when
you&amp;#39;re operating with the right technologies, with the right tactics, and aiming
for goals and objectives that are only possible with new combinations, you can
greatly outpace those who do not adopt such measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;06-pace-maximum-vs-maximum-sustainable-speed-&quot;&gt;06. Pace (Maximum vs Maximum Sustainable Speed)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://us2.campaign-archive.com/?u=6b601ddd13ae676e0c4d8b6a2&amp;amp;id=0c0cad8377&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the maximum possible pace, which is going as all-out fast as possible,
and which is typically sustainable only for a brief time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the maximum sustainable pace, which is going at a rate that doesn&amp;#39;t
deplete your capabilities faster than you can replenish them. It&amp;#39;s worth working
towards reaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can red-line and put in all-nighters with no sleep, consume heavy amounts of
stimulants and simple carbohydrates for energy, neglect recharging and
maintenance activities like leisure and fitness, and in doing this, you can do a
much greater amount of work in a short period of time than you could if you were
running at a sustainable pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you ever red-line yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a variety of smart opinions on this. One opinion is that being forced to
red-line is an error attributable to poor upstream planning. Another view is
that red-lining occasionally, going closer to the maximum possible pace, is
insightful in that it demonstrates what&amp;#39;s possible in a crisis and gives you a
better awareness of your capabilities under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible plan is to red-lining two or three times per year – say, once by
choice, and responding to two crises or large emergent opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One shouldn&amp;#39;t intentionally red-line too often, because it puts you in a fragile
and dangerous state following the red-lining. If a major opportunity or crisis
happens shortly after you&amp;#39;ve red-lined, you&amp;#39;re ill-equipped to handle it. Better
to red-line defensively and opportunistically rather than intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue 9 will deal with threshold breaks, but for now, suffice to say that it&amp;#39;s
one of the times that red-lining truly makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, there&amp;#39;s a threshold that, if you pass it, it makes a huge difference. If
you&amp;#39;re going much faster than the maximum sustainable pace, you should know in
advance when you can end it and recover from the damage you took. When there&amp;#39;s a
logical and obvious threshold or checkpoint to hit, this can help immensely. You
red-line to get past a threshold of wins or gains, and then recover afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;07-windows-of-opportunity&quot;&gt;07. Windows of Opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mailchi.mp/thestrategicreview/tsr-celerity-7-windows-of-opportunity?e=0264c979a5&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seize opportunities when they present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julius Caesar was certainly one of the figures in history who cultivated the
most celerity – he moved quickly in all things, usually to his advantage. When
the Senate threatened to make him a public enemy if he did not disband his
legions, he crossed the Rubicon. He suppressed Pompey&amp;#39;s loyalists in Spain
rapidly, and then moved to bring the fight to Pompey in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A large part of the cultivation of celerity is in seizing opportunities,
especially during a window when large gains can be made quickly and safely.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, major windows of opportunity are almost always going to
come with some measure of fear. Almost by definition, it&amp;#39;ll be something unusual
or surprising. &amp;quot;Is this really possible... ? Could I really... ?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this can be trained, to some extent, by rapidly moving on small
opportunities. Seeing an opportunity to go to a conference, or speak at an event
on short notice if one of the speakers dropped out, or traveling to a city to
meet someone you find admirable on short notice. Some people naturally move very
fast; most people do not. The ability to cut through fear and move quickly can
be trained, probably in small and low-stakes situations. You could arbitrarily
pick any unfamiliar event this weekend and attend it. That&amp;#39;s a very unusual
pattern for most people, but it can help for getting over fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, a brief caution around impatience and impulsiveness. One of the
most dangerous things is when you spot an opportunity as it&amp;#39;s developing, barely
miss it, and then jump into the fray late – it&amp;#39;s a common human error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re reasonably sure a company&amp;#39;s stock is going to go up because it&amp;#39;s doing
well, but you neglect to buy it, and then you see it rapidly double or triple –
a lot of people then jump in late, annoyed at themselves and neglecting to take
the gain, and buy after the gains have happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;08-surface-area-many-simultaneous-problems-&quot;&gt;08. Surface Area (Many Simultaneous Problems)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=6b601ddd13ae676e0c4d8b6a2&amp;amp;id=1c455f2537&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no quest logs in real life: you need to make your own, and seek worhty
missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As individuals, there&amp;#39;s only so much progress we can make at a given time. The
last and fundamental limit becomes the fact that we only have 168 hours per week
– even if doing everything else perfectly, we eventually run into this limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But practically speaking, oftentimes people get &amp;quot;bogged down&amp;quot; far before hitting
that limit, and often it&amp;#39;s only time or random feats of inspiration that break
through. Renowned scientists and mathematicians would often get stuck on a
particular problem for months or years before finally making a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution, then, is self-evident: learn about how to develop a greater
surface area of opportunities in our own lives. Seek more worthy missions. They
provide you with work to make progress on when you&amp;#39;re bogged down, and might
just provide you with the inspiration you need to break through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More surface area (good people, interesting problems, new skills and techniques)
lead to accomplishing more in life easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often view games as the opposite of work, but some sociologists believe
games are an idealized form of work. &amp;quot;Most people find work rewarding; we have
built-in emotional reward centers that encourage us to complete tasks&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their most basic levels, work and play look a lot alike. The difference
between the two is that games couch this kind of work in a fiction that makes
them enjoyable. A game&amp;#39;s narrative makes our choices feel significant enough
that we buy into the game emotionally, and the feedback system encourages us to
keep working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are more consistent at rewarding us for the choices we make and are
immediately rewarding, providing instant feedback when we do something right,
and telling us how well we perform every step along the way. These highly tuned
feedback systems are the key to turning video games into an indispensable tool
for bettering our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the mathematician Paul Erdos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for me his even greater importance is that he created a large number of
mathematicians. He was the problem poser par excellence. His ability to
formulate problems of any level of difficulty is legendary. Many people can
ask questions which are impossibly difficult or trivially easy. It is given to
few of us to tread the narrow path between triviality and unattainability.
Erdos problems were not Hilbert problems, which took half a century or more to
settle. Erdos questions were always just right. So often, when we are fumbling
with our research, it is because we are not asking the right question. Many of
Erdos&amp;#39;s questions have remained as outstanding but important problems, but
most have been attacked and partially, or perhaps completely, solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Erdos not only asked the right question. He asked them of the right
person. He knew better than you yourself knew what you were capable of. How
many people must have got started on research by solving a $5.00, or maybe
even a $1.00, Erdos problem? He gave the confidence that many of us needed to
embark on mathematical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had the unique ability to identify problems which were just beyond what you
could currently do. It&amp;#39;s easy to state impossible problems but he would state
a problem whereby if you could solve this problem you would then know more
than you knew before and open the door wider. It was like climbing a mountain
and being able to drive one more piton in to be able to work your way up the
mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By working on the right problems, the right missions, you can build up your
confidence and knowledge to tackle increasingly ambitious tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;09-threshold-breaks&quot;&gt;09. Threshold Breaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mailchi.mp/thestrategicreview/tsr-celerity-9-threshold-breaks?e=0264c979a5&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a closely-matched fight, whichever side breaks and flees first loses, and
often takes more casualties during retreat than they took in the fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a threshold break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A key aspect for celerity is understanding threshold and checkpoints. That is,
being able to recognize what targets you should sprint towards to collect large
amounts of gains.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But moving fast towards no objective doesn&amp;#39;t get you any results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one&amp;#39;s own life, it pays to be assess where the next set of major gains are
and to devote as many resources as possible towards breaking through to those
gains. Bravado, stubbornness, or a lack of reasoning about where those threshold
breaks are will lead – at best – to middling results, and at worst to disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mull over it some – many people work very hard and diligently, but do not
analyze where the next round of major breakthroughs will come from. Thus, their
efforts are diffused and they never reach the next levels and thresholds of
success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking, analysis, and emotional fortitude are ever and always required to get
focused on what really matters and stay focused on what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-speed-of-execution-project-selection-&quot;&gt;10. Speed of Execution (Project Selection)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://us2.campaign-archive.com/?u=6b601ddd13ae676e0c4d8b6a2&amp;amp;id=9d6e5ec7ad&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of Sebastian&amp;#39;s solo successes were &amp;quot;burst/incremental&amp;quot; projects that
were released in little pieces. He also noted that his collaborations tended to
succeed much more than his solo endeavours (about 90% vs 50% success rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a response, he started drastically cut down the number of solo projects he
did, and started looking to be more collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his perspective, it helped him immensely because before taking that
decision, many of his projects had been a mix of &amp;quot;too unclear&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;too clever&amp;quot;
in the initial setup and scoping of the project, and that had set him up for
failure as projects would get too complicated to ship out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When engaging in collaborations, the collaborator would catch these excessive
complications as they were hammering out a scope of things to do, and they&amp;#39;d
simplify the project scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burst/Incremental type of work tended to succeed more often because of two
reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular progress got made with lots of mini-deadlines getting clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback from the incremental/burst work was gotten and course corrections
could be made before getting oneself into a dead end of being stuck on some
large too-clever mess of a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian&amp;#39;s business partner, Kai Zau, emphasizes project selection as the most
crucial part of getting high project success rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came up with two criterions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the project &amp;quot;goldilocks-sized&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the project be completed within the &amp;quot;project honeymoon window&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick a project too small, and you won&amp;#39;t get enough gain. Too big and it could
fail or be a huge hassle to succeed with the costs outstripping the gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s better to finish a project while it is still fresh, exciting and
motivating. It should be complete within a few weeks or more rarely a few
months. It doesn&amp;#39;t feel good to have a project that lingers on. Complete the
project and collect the gains before things get stale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to complete his projects as fast as possible, Sebastian uses a
spreadsheet. For each active project he records:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the start date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the number of days elapsed since the start date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the number of days spent working on the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ratio between days spend working on the project and days elapsed (as a percentage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to minimize the number of days elapsed before completion, and of
course the best way to do this is to minimize the &amp;quot;advance percentage&amp;quot; (the
ratio).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Sebastian&amp;#39;s recommendation for improving speed of execution –
completing more projects successfully in less time – boil down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally sound good work habits (covered elsewhere)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Careful project selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimizing the days elapsed from the time a project starts until it completes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximizing the advance percentage – how many days you worked on a project while
it was active, towards concluding it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you have multiple ongoing projects, you&amp;#39;re better off taking a single
day to march one of them to completion than to &amp;quot;make a bit of progress&amp;quot; on all
of them. There is actually some research/math on project payoffs and decay rates
that supports this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;11-effectiveness-first&quot;&gt;11. Effectiveness First&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mailchi.mp/thestrategicreview/tsr-celerity-11-effectiveness-first?e=0264c979a5&quot;&gt;🔗 original issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done
at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Peter Drucker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our investigation so far, we looked at different aspects of celerity. A large
part of it is sizing up the world correctly – thus, knowing of Power Laws and
how to analyze them and hone in on them is important; likewise, being able to
spot windows of opportunity, emerging technical and sociotechnical trends, and
key potential threshold breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-management is key – we explored the difference between the maximum possible
pace and the maximum sustainable pace, and we honed in on specific instances of
each – looking at Paul Erdos and his surface area approach for an example of max
sustainable pace, and Friedrich Nietzsche&amp;#39;s frenzied genius for an example of
the maximum-possible-pace with its great rewards but also heavy downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last issue, we looked at raw speed of execution – with the perhaps
counterintuitive idea that project selection might be the key determinant of
speed of execution. Working in &amp;quot;goldilocks-sized&amp;quot; chunks of work and aiming to
get key initiatives done in the &amp;quot;honeymoon window&amp;quot; greatly helps with attaining
a higher speed of execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day, all of the raw Celerity in the world isn&amp;#39;t worth much
if deployed into the wrong areas – and so we end our series with an exploration
of some of Peter Drucker&amp;#39;s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is some thing
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not require special
gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness as an executive
demands doing certain — and fairly simple — things. Effectiveness can be learned
— and it also has to be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed is, broadly, a good thing. But rapidly dispatching and achieving a set of
things that results in nothing, that adds nothing to the world or one&amp;#39;s own life
– this is folly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness before efficiency: going somewhere before going fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; they fail to realize that the
brilliant insight is not by itself achievement. They never have learned that
insights become effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. While others rush
around in the frenzy and busyness which very bright people so often confuse with
&amp;quot;creativity,&amp;quot; the plodder puts one foot in front of the other and gets there
first, like the tortoise in the old fable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to become effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perform a &lt;a href=&quot;https://praxis.fortelabs.co/theory-of-constraints-101-table-of-contents-8bbb6627915b&quot;&gt;Theory of Constraints&lt;/a&gt;-type analysis. It will help you find the
area where work is needed in order to hit maximum performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answer the question &amp;quot;What needs to be done?&amp;quot; (not &amp;quot;What do I want to do?&amp;quot;).
The answer almost always contains more than one urgent task. But effective
executives do not splinter themselves. They concentrate on one task if at all
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drucker: &amp;quot;I have never encountered an executive who remains effective while
tackling more than two tasks at a time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of both effectiveness and celerity, whatever is the most important
thing should be focused on to the maximal extent possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems common sense, but most people either don&amp;#39;t know what their most
important thing is or are not making routine progress on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I know what the most important thing is?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I focusing on that to the maximal extent possible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Simple Math: Trade Rates</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;While I was driving on the highway the other day, I was thinking: &amp;quot;how much time
would I shave off if I drove at 150 km/h instead of at 120 km/h?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like that should have a very simple answer, but I wasn&amp;#39;t able to come
up with it immediately. Here are insights I gained after thinking a bit more
about that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;trade-rates&quot;&gt;Trade Rates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, let us state that speed is a trade rate. From a human perspective,
speed allows you to trade time for distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general a trade rate is a ratio &lt;code&gt;X/Y&lt;/code&gt; that states how much of a thing A we
can trade for a thing B:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; X   A
--- --- = 1
 Y   B

X A = Y B
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;So naturally, 120 km/h allows us to trade an hour for 120 kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;trade-rates-multiplications&quot;&gt;Trade Rates Multiplications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going from 120 km/h to 150 km/h, we add 30 km/h. That is precisely the quartier
of the base speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence: 150 = 120 * (1 + 1/4) = 120 * 5/4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see how this affects our trade rate equations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; 5   120   km
--- ----- ---- = 1
 4    1    h

5 * 120 km = 4 h

150 km = 1 h
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, we can now trade one hour for 150 kilometers. But what if we want
to keep 120 km on the left side of that equation? Say we actually have to drive
for 120 km, how much time do we save?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;5 * 120 km = 4 h

120 km = 4/5 h = 38 m
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We gained 1/5 of an hour, so 12 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s interesting: we increased our speed by a quarter, but only reduced the
time by a fifth. This is actually more intuitive when the numbers become larger:
double your speed, halve the required time, which corresponds to +100% speed for
-50% time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing to keep in mind is that we&amp;#39;re messing with the &lt;em&gt;trade rate&lt;/em&gt;. Given a
fixed speed, time and distance mirror one another: double the distance, double
the time, and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing: by multiplying the speed by 5/4, keeping the distance
fixed, we ended up multiplying the time by 4/5. The symmetry between those
numbers is not random. In fact we can generalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we multiply a trade rate &lt;code&gt;X/Y&lt;/code&gt; with units &lt;code&gt;A/B&lt;/code&gt; by a fraction &lt;code&gt;u/z&lt;/code&gt;, then either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can trade &lt;code&gt;u/z&lt;/code&gt; times the A for the same amount of B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can trade &lt;code&gt;z/u&lt;/code&gt; times the B for the same amount of A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math is fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; u   X   A
--- --- --- = 1
 z   Y   B

 u
--- X A = Y B
 z
       z
X A = --- Y B
       u
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;trade-rates-increases&quot;&gt;Trade Rates Increases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can think about this in another way. Multiplying the speed by 5/4 was
actually multiplying it by (1 + 1/4), so we can see this as an 1/4 increase in
speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, when your speed increase by one quarter, you can drive one quarter more
kilometers in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s less intuitive from the other side: when your speed increases by 1/4, how
much does the time spent decrease? We already know the answer is 1/5, but how to
find this without going through the whole development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need a side property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Property: Numerator Swap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I have no idea how this property is called in reality, or whether it even has a name)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   X             Y
------- = 1 - -------
 X + Y         X + Y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   X       X + Y     X + Y       X
------- = ------- - ------- + -------  (1)
 X + Y     X + Y     X + Y     X + Y

                 Y
        = 1 - -------                  (2)
               X + Y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In (1) we simply add and remove &lt;code&gt;(X+Y)/(X+Y)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (2), the first term becomes 1, while the &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; in the second and third terms
have different signs and cancel each other out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End Side Property&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so we wanted to know how to get that 1/5 diminution in time from the 1/4
(&lt;code&gt;u/z&lt;/code&gt; if we abstract) increase in speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      u    X   A
(1 + ---) --- --- = 1
      z    Y   B

 z + u
------- X A = Y B           (1)
   z

         z
X A = ------- Y B           (2)
       z + u

              u
X A = (1 - -------) Y B     (3)
            z + u
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In (1), we pass &lt;code&gt;Y B&lt;/code&gt; to the other side, and we replace &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; by the equivalent
&lt;code&gt;z/z&lt;/code&gt;, leading to the simplified &lt;code&gt;(z + u) / z&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (2), we just pass that term to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (3), we use our side property and get our final form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our speed example, &lt;code&gt;u/z = 1/4&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;u = 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;z = 4&lt;/code&gt;. We can see that &lt;code&gt;u /
(z + u)&lt;/code&gt; is indeed 1/5, and as the equation shows, that is the portion that the
quantity of B gets reduced by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist of this is: add the numerator to the denominator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 1/5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2/3 &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 2/5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3/4 &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 3/7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy peasy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;diminishing-returns&quot;&gt;Diminishing Returns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final interesting observation: there is a diminishing return on trade rate
increase (assuming you&amp;#39;re on the right side of the equation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obvious with speed. Double the speed, halve the time spent to go the
same distance. Double the speed again, halve the time again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine our base speed is 60 km/h and we have precisely 60 km to go until our
destination. If we change our speed to 120 km/h, we gain 30 minutes in travel
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we were driving at 120 km/h, and we change our speed to 240 km/h, we only
gain 15 minutes (half of our 30 minutes travel time at 120 km/h).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re driving at 60 km/h, and you add 60 km/h, you gain 30 minutes. But
if you immediately add 120 km/h more, you only gain 15 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is because we&amp;#39;re changing the rate. Given a fixed speed, adding more
time will yield a linear increase in distance travelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for today. Drive safe!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Imperative Ambiguity</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;A while ago I realized that something people value about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming&quot;&gt;purely functional
programming&lt;/a&gt; is the certainties it gives about a function&amp;#39;s signature. That
might seem obvious, after all there is no data mutation and no side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, however, am not a fan of purely functional programming. This is not a debate
I want to wade in; it suffice to say that I enjoy using purely functional
programming techniques, but despise being forced to write my whole program using
that paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am much more interested in what it means not to have these guarantees, and the
resulting ambiguity in function signatures. And of course, how we could make
things better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-ambiguous-function&quot;&gt;An Ambiguous Function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following function signature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; process(List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; list);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a purely functional language, you know that &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; cannot be modified, and
the returned list will depend only on &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; and whatever data was captured via
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;closure&lt;/a&gt; at the function definition point (data which, of course, does not
change).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an imperative language, however, the following is unclear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can &lt;code&gt;process&lt;/code&gt; modify &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does &lt;code&gt;process&lt;/code&gt; modify any state beside &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does &lt;code&gt;process&lt;/code&gt; store a reference to &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; in some other data structure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does &lt;code&gt;process&lt;/code&gt; store a reference to the list it returns in some other data
structure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the returned list be &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; itself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two questions are about mutation, but the last three questions are
relevant &lt;em&gt;because of&lt;/em&gt; mutation. It&amp;#39;s important to know who can access the list,
because of the possibility it might be mutated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;caller-and-callee&quot;&gt;Caller and Callee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important for us to distinguish between the caller and the callee.
The caller is the entity that makes the function call, while the callee is the
entity to which the called function belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are those entities? Different views can apply: they could be packages,
modules, classes, objects, clients or libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the most interesting case is when the caller and the callee are evolved
separately. In this scenario the author/maintainer of the callee does not need
to be aware of the caller, and the author/maintainer of the caller only needs to
be aware of the interface of the callee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about ambiguity, we talk about the ambiguity of this interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;interpretations&quot;&gt;Interpretations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s consider a few possible interpretations of the function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; process(List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; list);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immutable&lt;/strong&gt;: no one can modify the argument list: not the caller, not the
callee, nor anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Loan&lt;/strong&gt;: the callee is allowed to read the list, but not write to it nor
create a reference that outlives the function&amp;#39;s execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write Loan&lt;/strong&gt;: the callee is allowed to read and write the list, but not
create a reference that outlives the function&amp;#39;s execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer&lt;/strong&gt;: the callee may do whatever it wants with the list, the caller may
not retain a reference to the list that outlives its execution; or, even more
stringently, may not access the list at all after the call to &lt;code&gt;process&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pipe In&lt;/strong&gt;: the callee may read the list and retain a read-only reference that
outlives the function&amp;#39;s execution. The caller may still read and write the
list. Data is being &lt;em&gt;piped in&lt;/em&gt; the callee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pipe Out&lt;/strong&gt;: the callee may read or write the list and retain a reference that
outlives the functions&amp;#39;s execution. The caller may still read the list. Data
is being &lt;em&gt;piped out&lt;/em&gt; of the callee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sync&lt;/strong&gt;: the callee may read or write the list and retain a reference that
outlives the function&amp;#39;s execution. The caller may still read and write the
list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since things are complex enough as it is, we omit discussing whether the
returned list is an alias or the argument list, as well as considerations
relating to concurrent execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-practice&quot;&gt;In Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to disambiguate all these scenarios in a way that can be enforced
by a compiler?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe. We could imagine keywords on parameters to enforce those. Simple
(function-local) flow analysis should be sufficient to implement most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m eager to see new languages that engage with this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest thing we have currently is probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;, but it restricts the
possible scenarios a lot for the sake of precisely tracking the ownership of a
piece of data, which is necessary for its &lt;abbr title=&quot;Garbage
Collection&quot;&gt;GC&lt;/abbr&gt;-less memory management system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Charlie Munger: Psychological Tendencies List</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;This is post 4/4 in &lt;a href=&quot;/munger&quot;&gt;a series about Charlie Munger&amp;#39;s wisdom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;01-reward-and-punishment-superresponse-tendency&quot;&gt;01. Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone claims to understand it, yet it is still under-evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.&lt;br&gt;— Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the
power of incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skinner (a famous psychologist) demonstrated again and again a great recurring,
generalized behavioral algorithm in nature: &amp;quot;Repeat behavior that works.&amp;quot; He
also demonstrated that prompt rewards worked much better than delayed rewards in
changing and maintaining behavior. And, once his rats and pigeons had
conditioned reflexes, caused by food rewards, he found what withdrawal pattern
of rewards kept the reflexive behavior longest in place: random distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general antidotes here are: (1) especially fear professional advice when it
is especially good for the advisor; (2) learn and use the basic elements of your
advisor&amp;#39;s trade as you deal with your advisor; and (3) double check, disbelieve,
or replace much of what you&amp;#39;re told, to the degree that seems appropriate after
objective thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost-plus-percent-of-cost contracts are evil: they incentivize contractors to
drive up the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it hard to cheat: cash register, good accounting practices. People will
steal if it&amp;#39;s very easy, and the stealing will become habitual. Make it hard to
cheat, otherwise you&amp;#39;re inflicting moral injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dread, and avoid as much you can, rewarding people for what can be easily faked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punishments, of course, also strongly influence behavior and cognition, although
not so flexibly and wonderfully as rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;02-liking-loving-tendency&quot;&gt;02. Liking/Loving Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Liking/Loving Tendency acts as a conditioning device that makes the liker or
lover tend to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignore faults of and comply with wishes of, the object of his affection;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;favor people, products, and actions merely associated&lt;br&gt;with the object of his affection;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distort other facts to facilitate love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of liking and loving causing admiration also works in reverse.
Admiration also causes or intensifies liking or love. This can be both positive,
when liking someone admirable, or negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#03-disliking-hating-tendency&quot;&gt;03. Disliking/Hating Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;03-disliking-hating-tendency&quot;&gt;03. Disliking/Hating Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to disfavor people we already dislike and hate to level of
irrationality. This results in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignoring virtues of people we dislike;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disliking people, products, and actions merely associated&lt;br&gt;with the object of our dislike;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distorting facts in order to facilitate the hatred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sibling rivalry. Historical enmity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts from both camps have very little overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#02-liking-loving-tendency&quot;&gt;02. Liking/Loving Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#10-influence-from-mere-association-tendency&quot;&gt;10. Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;04-doubt-avoidance-tendency&quot;&gt;04. Doubt-Avoidance Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by
reaching some decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we shall see later when we get to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#15-social-proof-tendency&quot;&gt;15. Social-Proof Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#17-stress-influence-tendency&quot;&gt;17. Stress-Influence Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, what usually triggers
Doubt-Avoidance Tendency is some combination of (1) puzzlement and (2) stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;05-inconsistency-avoidance-tendency&quot;&gt;05. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&lt;br&gt;— Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency makes it much easier to prevent a habit than to
change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also tending to be maintained in place by the anti-change tendency of the brain
are one&amp;#39;s previous conclusions, human loyalties, reputational identity,
commitments, accepted role in a civilization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tendency overlaps with what is known as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&quot;&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One corollary of Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency is that a person making big
sacrifices in the course of assuming a new identity will intensify his devotion
to the new identity. After all, it would be quite inconsistent behavior to make
a large sacrifice for something that was no good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he was rising from obscurity in Philadelphia and wanted the approval of some
important man, Franklin would often maneuver that man into doing Franklin some
unimporrant favor like lending Franklin a book. Thereafter the man would admire
and trust Franklin more because a nonadmired and nontrusted Franklin would be
inconsistent with the appraisal implicit in lending Franklin the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one is maneuvered into deliberately hurting some other person, one will
tend to disapprove or even hate that person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So strong is Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency that it will often prevail after
one has merely pretended to have some identity habit, or conclusion. Many a
hypocrite is improved by his pretensions of virtue. And many a judge and juror,
while pretending objectivity, is gaining objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important not to thus put one&amp;#39;s brain in chains before one has come
anywhere near his full potentiality as a rational person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;06-curiosity-tendency&quot;&gt;06. Curiosity Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put: curiosity helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;07-kantian-fairness-tendency&quot;&gt;07. Kantian Fairness Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_RuleT&quot;&gt;the golden rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;do unto others as you would have them do unto you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an obverse consequence of such &amp;quot;fair-sharing&amp;quot; conduct, much reactive
hostility occurs when fair-sharing is expected yet not provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;08-envy-jealousy-tendency&quot;&gt;08. Envy/Jealousy Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not greed that drives the world, but envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;09-reciprocation-tendency&quot;&gt;09. Reciprocation Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to reciprocate favors and (perceived) slights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always tell the man off tomorrow if it is such a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#05-inconsistency-avoidance-tendency&quot;&gt;05. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reciprocating concessions: start with an outrageous demand then lower it to get
a better chance of compliance than if you had asked outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-influence-from-mere-association-tendency&quot;&gt;10. Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, associating price with quality. Mistaking correlation for
causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other example: killing the messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;11-simple-pain-avoiding-psychological-denial&quot;&gt;11. Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;12-excessive-self-regard-tendency&quot;&gt;12: Excessive Self-Regard Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man mostly misappraises himself on the high side. This also extends to one
person&amp;#39;s major/minor possessions, friends, family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect&quot;&gt;endowment effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: owned, a possession suddenly becomes worth more to him
than he would pay if they were offered for sale and he didn&amp;#39;t already own them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When members of a clique exhibit self-regard tendency, they will select new
members very much like themselves. The problems will get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excesses of self-regard often cause bad hiring decisions because employers
grossly overappraise the worth of their own conclusions that rely on impressions
in face-to-face contact. The correct antidote to this sort of folly is to
underweigh face-to-face impressions and overweigh the applicant&amp;#39;s past record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;13-overoptimism-tendency&quot;&gt;13. Overoptimism Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a man wishes, that also will he believe.&lt;br&gt;— Demosthenes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;14-deprival-superreaction-tendency&quot;&gt;14. Deprival-Superreaction Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gain less happiness from gaining 10$ than we lose from losing 10$.
This is also known as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion&quot;&gt;loss aversion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost getting something then having it denied will hurt as much as if it was
already owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss avertion is often framed by availability: getting angry over losing 10$ out
of 300$ in our wallet when we have tens of thousands in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tendency acts to protect religious/ideological views against nonbelievers,
because the spread of nonbelievers&amp;#39; ideas and arguments will weaken the
position/influence of the views. It leads to ideology-based groupthink and
rejecting conflicting inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be triggered even more strongly when the nonbeliever is a former
believer: not only are the ideas challenged, but the group suffers the loss of
one of its members, and there is fear that this nonbeliever will be
extra-convincing because he was a former member. Hence the notion of &lt;em&gt;heresy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tendency also interacts with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#05-inconsistency-avoidance-tendency&quot;&gt;05. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:
(1) in groupthink, (2) in continuing to pour ressources in a fruitless venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tendency explains gambling woes: it gives us an urge to get even after a
loss, and increases the emotional impact of near wins (two 7s, one cherry on the
slot machine where three 7s yield the jackpot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;15-social-proof-tendency&quot;&gt;15. Social-Proof Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young people are hardwired to respect their peers more than their parents. A
trick parents can use: control the quality of the peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social proof tendency is most easily triggered in the presence of puzzlement or
stress (see &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#04-doubt-avoidance-tendency&quot;&gt;04. Doubt-Avoidance Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#17-stress-influence-tendency&quot;&gt;17. Stress-Influence Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), or in particular both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because both bad and good behavior are made contagious by social proof, it 
is important to (1) stop bad behaviour before it spreads and (2) foster and
display all good behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In social proof, it is not only action by others that misleads but also their
inaction. In the presence of doubt, inaction by others becomes social proof that
inaction is the right course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social-proof tendency often interacts in a perverse way
with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#08-envy-jealousy-tendency&quot;&gt;08. Envy/Jealousy Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#14-deprival-superreaction-tendency&quot;&gt;14. Deprival-Superreaction Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: e.g. two kids vying for the
same toy, amongst a heap of almost identical toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;16-contrast-misreaction-tendency&quot;&gt;16. Contrast-Misreaction Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to contrast things with other things that are close to hand. Paying a
lot of money for something, because we just made a much (justifiably) bigger
purchase. The realtor that shows awful houses before a merely bad one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring&quot;&gt;anchoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and related to
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#18-availability-misweighing-tendency&quot;&gt;18. Availability-Misweighing Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognition, misled by tiny changes involving low contrast, will often miss a
trend that is destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small leak will sink a great ship.&lt;br&gt;— Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;17-stress-influence-tendency&quot;&gt;17. Stress-Influence Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#15-social-proof-tendency&quot;&gt;15. Social-Proof Tendency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When heavy, can cause depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can disrupt &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic&quot;&gt;pavlovian conditioning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pavlov noticed that the harder a dog was to break, the hardest it was to return
to his pre-breakdown state. All dogs could be broken down, and he couldn&amp;#39;t
reverse a breakdown except through new stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;18-availability-misweighing-tendency&quot;&gt;18. Availability-Misweighing Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic&quot;&gt;availability bias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We overvalue evidence (or increase the importance of stuff) that is readily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivid images are more readily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In group environments, simple explanations of complex phenomena can rapidly gain
currency and spread even if they’re wrong. This is known as availability
cascade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tendency can be fought by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using checklists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasizing discomfirming evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using a devil&amp;#39;s advocate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not speaking first so as not to influence others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;19-use-it-or-lose-it-tendency&quot;&gt;19. Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All skills attenuate with disuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tendency is tempered for the diligent: If a skill is raised to fluency,
instead of merely being crammed in briefly to enable one to pass some test, then
the skill (1) will be lost more slowly and (2) will come back faster when
refreshed with new learning. These are not minor advantages, and a wise man
engaged in learning some important skill will not stop until he is really fluent
in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;20-drug-misinfluence-tendency&quot;&gt;20. Drug Misinfluence Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, and note one can be addicted to more than just chemicals — our body
is more than happy to manufacture the chemicals for us if we provide it with the
right inputs (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReRcHdeUG9Y&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; for instance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;21-senescence-misinfluence-tendencv&quot;&gt;21. Senescence-Misinfluence Tendencv&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically no one is good at learning complex new skills when very old. But
some people remain pretty good in maintaining intensely practiced old skills
until late in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous thinking and learning, done with joy can somewhat help delay what is
inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;22-authority-misinfluence-tendency&quot;&gt;22. Authority-Misinfluence Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also trust leaders in areas where they are not experts. This is known as the

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;23-twaddle-tendency&quot;&gt;23. Twaddle Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twaddle is idle talk, in particular talk about something the person isn&amp;#39;t an

and from importunating people that do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;24-reason-respecting-tendency&quot;&gt;24. Reason-Respecting Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately also works with incorrect or invalid reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Charlie Munger on Learning</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;This is post 3/4 in &lt;a href=&quot;/munger&quot;&gt;a series about Charlie Munger&amp;#39;s wisdom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My habit of committing far more time to learning and thinking than to doing is
no accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important than the will to win is the will to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acquire Wordly Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up.
Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not
necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast
spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day – if
you live long enough – most people get what they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquire worldly wisdom and adjust your behavior accordingly. If your new
behavior gives you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group... then
to hell with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read a Lot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter
area) who didn&amp;#39;t read all the time - none, zero. You&amp;#39;d be amazed at how much
Warren reads - and at how much I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is wisdom you’re after, you’re going to spend a lot of time on your ass
reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We read a lot. I don’t know anyone who’s wise who doesn’t read a lot. But
that’s not enough: You have a to have a temperament to grab ideas and do
sensible things. Most people don’t grab the right ideas or don’t know what to
do with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and
think. That is very uncommon in American business. I read and think. So I do
more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most people in
business. I do it because I like this kind of life.&lt;br&gt;— Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn The Easily Learned Principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever
figured out. I don’t believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up
yourself. Nobody’s that smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never ceases to amaze me to see how much territory can be grasped if one
merely masters and consistently uses all the obvious and easily learned
principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a simple idea and take it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a biography nut myself. And I think when you&amp;#39;re trying to teach the great
concepts that work, it helps to tie them into the lives and personalities of
the people who developed them. I think you learn economics better if you make
Adam Smith your friend. That sounds funny, making friends among the eminent
dead, but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had
the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life and work better
in education. It&amp;#39;s way better than just giving the basic concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea Destruction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all are learning, modifying, or destroying ideas all the time. Rapid
destruction of your ideas when the time is right is one of the most valuable
qualities you can acquire. You must force yourself to consider arguments on
the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to destroy your ideas rapidly instead of slowly when the occasion
is right is one of the most valuable things. You have to work hard on it. Ask
yourself what are the arguments on the other side. It’s bad to have an opinion
you’re proud of if you can’t state the arguments for the other side better
than your opponents. This is a great mental discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any year that passes in which you don’t destroy one of your best loved ideas
is a wasted year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what could be better than
to swap it for your old, less useful tool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every Experience is a Chance To Learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life will have terrible blows in it, horrible blows, unfair blows. It doesn&amp;#39;t
matter. And some people recover and others don&amp;#39;t. And there I think the
attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every missed chance in life
was an opportunity to behave well. Every missed chance in life was an
opportunity to learn something and that your duty was not to be submerged in
self-pity. But instead to utilize the terrible blow in constructive fashion.
That is a very good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is really useful to be reminded of your errors. I think Warren Buffett and
I are pretty good at that. We do kind of mentally rub our own noses in our own
mistakes. And that is a very good mental habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus Over a Long Timespan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrating hard on something that’s important, I can’t succeed at all
without doing it. I did not succeed in life by intelligence. I succeeded
because I have a long attention span.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplicity is the end result of long, hard work, not the starting point.&lt;br&gt;— Frederick Maitland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to have a passionate interest in why things are happening. That cast
of mind, kept over long periods, gradually improves your ability to focus on
reality. If you dont have the cast of mind, you&amp;#39;re destined for failure even
if you have a high I.Q.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn to Fluency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep structure of the human mind requires that the way to full-scope
competency of virtually any kind is learn it all to fluency, like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a skill is raised to fluency, instead of merely being crammed in briefly to
enable one to pass some test, then the skill (1) will be lost more slowly and
(2) will come back faster when refreshed with new learning. These are not
minor advantages, and a wise man engaged in learning some important skill will
not stop until he is really fluent in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Charlie Munger: How to Think and Make Decisions</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;This is post 2/4 in &lt;a href=&quot;/munger&quot;&gt;a series about Charlie Munger&amp;#39;s wisdom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Try to be Smart, Avoid Idiocy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by
trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very
intelligent. There must be some wisdom in the folk saying &amp;quot;It’s the strong
swimmers who drown.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try to profit from always remembering the obvious than from grasping the
esoteric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people are trying to be smart, all I’m trying to be is non-idiotic. I’ve
found that’s all you have to do to get ahead in life, be non-idiotic and live
a long time. It’s harder to be non-idiotic than most people think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organized common (or uncommon) sense is an enormously powerful tool. There are
huge dangers with computers. People calculate too much and think too little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of the scientific method and effective checklists minimizes errors and
omissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t overlook the obvious by drowning in minutiae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrict Yourself to your Circle of Competence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawning of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have a strength, it is in recognizing when we are operating well within
our circle of competence and when we are approaching the perimeter.&lt;br&gt;— Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in fairy tales are emperors told they are naked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to predict the future of everything, you attempt too much. You’re
going to fail through lack of specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mimicking the herd, invites regression to the mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person
to fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are, If you play games where
other people have the aptitudes and you don&amp;#39;t, you&amp;#39;re going to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invert, Always Invert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it
backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where don’t we want to go,
and how do you get there? Instead of looking for success, make a list of how
to fail instead. Tell me where I’m going to die, that is, so I don’t go there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was greatly helped in my quest by two turns of mind. First, I had long
looked for insight by inversion in the intense manner counseled by the great
algebraist, Jacobi: &amp;quot;Invert, always invert.&amp;quot; I sought good judgment mostly by
collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such
outcomes. Second, I became so avid a collector of instances of bad judgement
that I paid no attention to boundaries between professional territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as multiple factors shape almost every system, multiple models from a
variety of disciplines, applied with fluency, are needed to understand that
system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to keep in mind is the idea that especially big forces
often come out of these one hundred models. When several models combine, you get
lollapalooza effects; this is when two, three, or four forces are all operating
in the same direction. And, frequently, you dont get simple addition. It&amp;#39;s often
like a critical mass in physics where you get a nuclear explosion if you get to
a certain point of mass - and you dont ger anything much worth seeing if you
don&amp;#39;t reach the mass. Sometimes the forces just add like ordinary quantities and
sometimes they combine on a breakpoint or critical-mass basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More commonly, the forces coming out of these one hundred models are
conflicting to some extent. And you get huge, miserable tradeoffs. But if you
can&amp;#39;t think in terms of tradeoffs and recognize tradeoffs in what you&amp;#39;re
dealing with, you&amp;#39;re a horse&amp;#39;s patoot. You clearly are a danger to the rest of
the people when serious thinking is being done. You have to recognize how
these things combine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve long believed that a certain system - which almost any intelligent person
can learn - works way better than the systems that most people use. What you
need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And, with that system,
things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially important examples of these models include the redundancy/backup
system model from engineering, the compound interest model from mathematics,
the breakpoint / tipping-moment / autocatalysis models from physics and
chemistry, the modern Darwinian synthesis model from biology, and cognitive
misjudgment models from psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#39;ve gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First,
what are the factors that really govern the interests invoked, rationally
considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain
at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions in various ways -
which, by and large, are useful - but which often malfunction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can smart people so often be wrong? They don&amp;#39;t do what I&amp;#39;m telling you to
do: use a checklist to be sure you get all the main models and use them
together in a multimodular way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
