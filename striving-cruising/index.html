<p>There is a question that everyone tends to ask themselves at one point or
another and that question is <em>What should I do with my life?</em></p>
<p>I don&#39;t think there is a higher value that overrides all other. Unless it is so
general as to be tautological. Some call this tautological value <em>happiness</em>, or
more scientifically <em>subjective well-being</em> or <em>life satisfaction</em>.</p>
<p>We often try to answer the question in terms of goals and objectives. That&#39;s not
necessarily the right approach. After all, all we can ever decide is what to do
right here, right now. Still, it raises the following question: Is it necessary
to achieve to be happy? Should you just cruise through life and take in the
sights? Or strive towards a goal worthy of you?</p>
<p><strong>I sincerely believe that happiness requires meaning, and meaning requires a
struggle. You should strive, but focus on the quality of the striving rather
than on the end goal. Cruise if you must, but cruise towards something. Strive,
but don&#39;t be consumed by the goal.</strong></p>
<p>There were many inspirations that led me to that conclusion, but the following
three I find the most illuminating:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.fs.blog/2014/05/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/">Finding Your Purpose and Living a Meaningful Life</a></p>
<p>A thorough examination of the idea of striving versus cruising.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t know what to do with your life, have you at least started
looking?</p>
<p>Strive to be yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://markmanson.net/question">The Most Important Question of Your Life</a></p>
<p>What pain do you want in life? Looking for the pain you enjoy or even
tolerate better than other goes a long way towards finding somewhat you will
find meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2015/11/worry-less/">How to Worry Less</a></p>
<p>The vast majority of life consists of getting somewhere else. There are very
few moments of arrival, and they are over as soon as they begin. If you feel
like you need to be there before you can fully relax into where you are, then
you will seldom be relaxed in life.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Post Scriptum</strong></p>
<p>This used to be a huge series of posts tackling the grand question of the
meaning of life. I spent tens of hours writing and editing these posts... and
came to hate them with a passion. It came from a good place: I wanted to share
all my inspirations, all the connections that I&#39;d developped. But at the same
time it felt like I was trying to look clever all the time.</p>
<p>I was <a href="https://sivers.org/7">inspired</a> by Derek Sivers to just extract the essential point and trash
the rest. I&#39;m glad I did.</p>
