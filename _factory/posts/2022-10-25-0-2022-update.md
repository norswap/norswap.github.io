This blog has been rather less active than it should have been.

I, however, have been busy, working at [Optimism](https://optimism.io) on
[Bedrock] and [Cannon].

A lot of the action has instead been on [my Twitter][twitter]. See in particular [this
thread][bestof] collecting the biggest hits.

[Bedrock]: https://dev.optimism.io/introducing-optimism-bedrock/
[Cannon]: https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/cannon-cannon-cannon-introducing-cannon-4ce0d9245a03
[twitter]: https://twitter.com/norswap/
[bestof]: https://twitter.com/norswap/status/1501920423662997504

For discoverability and archival purpose, I've ported some of these tweet
threads on the block, backdated to the original date. Here they are:

- [ZK Rollups vs Optimistic Rollups](/zk-vs-optimistic)
- [How Cannon Works](/cannon-intro)
- [Design of the $DJED Stablecoin](/djed-stable)
- [Velodrome and why it's a superior system for incentivizing liquidity](/velodrome-liquidity)
- [AMM Meditations üçÉ](/amm-meditations)
