      <h1 class="post-title">Gumption and Areté</h1>
      <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2016</span>
<p>This post is part 3/3 in a series about Robert Pirsig&#39;s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance">Zen and the Art of
motorcycle Maintenance</a>. See also <a href="/stuckness-and-understanding">part 1</a> and <a href="/peace-of-mind">part 2</a>.</p>
<p>This post will talk about two notions that Pirsig puts forward: <em>gumption</em> and
<em>areté</em>. Gumption is originally a Scottish term, meaning &quot;common sense,
shrewdness&quot;, but also &quot;drive, initiative&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>A person filled with gumption doesn&#39;t sit around dissipating and stewing about
things. He&#39;s at the front of the train of his own awareness, watching to see
what&#39;s up the track and meeting it when it comes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gumption-filling occurs when one is quiet long enough to see, hear and feel the
real universe, not just one&#39;s own stale opinions about it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s common in people returning from long fishing trips. They seemingly have put
a lot of time for nothing, but in reality they come back with an abundance of
gumption, usually for the very same things they were sick to death of a few
weeks before. It&#39;s not wasted time.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;Gumption is the psychic gasoline that keeps the whole thing going.&quot; It is
necessary to all psychic tasks of interest. If you don&#39;t have it, you might as
well not start. Similarly, its level must be monitored at all times.</p>
<p>When gumption loss occur: take a long break, don&#39;t rush in to make up for lost
gumption.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the gumption <em>traps</em> is ego:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the untrained eye ego-climbing and selfless climbing may appear identical.
Both kinds of climbers place one foot in front of the other. Both breathe in
and out at the same rate. Both stop when tired. Both go forward when rested.
But what a difference! The ego-climber is like an instrument that’s out of
adjustment. He puts his foot down an instant too soon or too late. He’s likely
to miss a beautiful passage of sunlight through the trees. He goes on when the
sloppiness of his step shows he’s tired. He rests at odd times. He looks up
the trail trying to see what’s ahead even when he knows what’s ahead because
he just looked a second before. He goes too fast or too slow for the
conditions and when he talks his talk is forever about somewhere else,
something else. He’s here but he’s not here. He rejects the here, he’s unhappy
with it, wants to be farther up the trail but when he gets there will be just
as unhappy because then it will be “here”. What he’s looking for, what he
wants, is all around him, but he doesn’t want that because it is all around
him. Every step’s an effort, both physically and spiritually, because he
imagines his goal to be external and distant.</p>

<p>(Thanks to my friend Stanislav for bringing this quote to my attention.)</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Areté</em> is a greek notion that refers to excellence, acquired not as a duty to
others but to oneself.</p>
<p>Areté implies excelling in many domains in life, a respect for the wholeness of
one&#39;s life. It implies contempt for efficiency, or rather a higher idea for
efficiency, an efficiency which exists not in one department of life but in life
itself.</p>
