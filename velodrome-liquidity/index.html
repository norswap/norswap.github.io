      <span class="post-date">07 Jun 2022</span>
<p>This was originally a <a href="https://twitter.com/norswap/status/1533991540896321536">tweet thread</a> that I have reproduced here for
discoverability and archive purposes (the copy was done on 24 October 2022).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve only slightly reformatted the text (mostly links), otherwise this is the
original version.</p>
<hr>
<p>1/54🧵 Thread on <a href="https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi">@VelodromeFi</a> and why it&#39;s a superior system for incentivizing
liquidity.</p>
<p>2/ Liquidity is super important for project tokens. A lack of liquidity makes
the token price too volatile. It also prevents investors for exiting, which
makes them wary to invest in the first place.</p>
<p>3/ (And more cynically, such a liquidity pool also doubles as another use case
for the token, to prevent excessive selling.)</p>
<p>4/ The problem is that, for unpegged pairs, being a liquidity provider (LP)
sucks, because of impermanent loss (IL). Price goes up? You would have been
better holding and not LPing. Price goes down? Same thing.</p>
<p>5/ As an LP, you are the counterparty of adversely selected trades. You end up
owning more tokens when price decreases, and less tokens when price increases.</p>
<p>6/ The IL numbers are not egregious, but can easily outpace fee APY. You can
play with this app to get a sense:
<a href="https://baller.netlify.app/">https://baller.netlify.app/</a></p>
<p>7/ For this reason, projects need to incentivize liquidity. Usually, this is
done by bestowing tokens on LPs, to increase APY and make IL risk worthwhile.</p>
<p>8/ In this context, Velodrome and its predecessors/competitiors (<a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance">@CurveFinance</a> +
<a href="https://twitter.com/ConvexFinance">@ConvexFinance</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/solidlyexchange">@solidlyexchange</a>) offer two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A marketplace for liquidity: no need to roll you own pools &amp; incentive logic,
easy to advertise to prospective LPs</li>
</ol>
<p>9/</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The opportunity to purchase 1$ worth of incentive for less than 1$ worth of
project token.</li>
</ol>
<p>10/ How does that work? Every voting period (one week for Velodrome), token
rewards ($VELO) are emitted and distributed amongst the LPs of the liquidity
pools on velodrome.</p>
<p>11/ The amount of rewards per pool is decided by a vote. A pool receives an
amount of reward proportional to its share of the total vote. To vote, users
have to lock their $VELO (for up to 4 years, longer locks beget more voting
power).</p>
<p>12/ Multiple strategies are possible. Projects can just acquire $VELO directly
and lock it: this lets them direct a stream of future emissions to their pools.
The point being for the price paid for $VELO will be less than the value of all
future emissions.</p>
<p>13/ This can also be good if projects are more confident about the future price
of $VELO than of their own token&#39;s. Instead of printing more and more token for
liquidity rewards (creating a death spiral), they can simply rely on the
emissions.</p>
<p>14/ Alternatively, they can &quot;bribe&quot; existing lockers for their votes, by
assigning them rewards in their project tokens. This can be appealing to
projects, even early on, because they don&#39;t need to sell a big chunk of project
token at once to finance the purchase of $VELO.</p>
<p>15/ Here too, there is a possibility to get 1$ of $VELO LP reward for less than
1$ of project token bribe.</p>
<p>To make a profit (and ignoring at the moment fees and rebases), lockers want to
earn more per locked $VELO than the dilution created by the $VELO emissions.</p>
<p>16/ Each emitted $VELO dilutes holders by (1 / (oldTotalSupply + 1)). So the
minimum non-dilutive bribe per $VELO bribed is (veloPrice * veloEmitted * (1 /
(oldTotalSupply + 1)).</p>
<p>17/ If every $VELO was locked and its vote was bribe-sensitive, you&#39;d have to
bribe one $VELO worth per $VELO emitted.</p>
<p>The key to capital efficiency for projects here is that not all $VELO is locked
(only ~50% atm, I expect this to increase).</p>
<p>18/ Furthermore, not every locker is bribe-sensitive: project that bought $VELO
to incentivize their pool will not vote on other pools.</p>
<p>Also $VELO locked for less than 4 years does not get maximum voting power.</p>
<p>19/ Therefore, in the worst/best case (depending on whose perpective you adopt),
projects get a discount by diluting non locked $VELO, bribe-insensitive $VELO,
and (to a smaller extent) short-duration $VELO lockers.</p>
<p>20/ We should also mention that $VELO lockers also benefit from a &quot;rebase&quot;:
token accrued every voting period that are supposed to protect them from
dilution. The rebase amount for each voting period is given by this formula:</p>
<p>21/ (veVELO.totalSupply ÷ VELO.totalsupply)³ × 0.5 × Emissions</p>
<p>So if half of all $VELO is locked, lockers will collectively received 1/16
(6.25%) of all emissions as extra $VELO. This would be 36% at 90% locked and 50%
at 100% locked.</p>
<p>22/ Why do I say &quot;supposed&quot; above? Well <a href="https://twitter.com/norswap/status/1498358050620514304">just like in OlympusDAO</a>, rebases just
make you run in place faster.</p>
<p>However, they do have the net effect of diluting non-locked $VELO faster
compared to locked $VELO.</p>
<p>23/ Note that bribe-insensitive $VELO lockers (usually projects) are not
necessarily worse for wear: as stated above, the purchasing assumption was that
the total value of future emissions would exceed the initial purchase price.</p>
<p>24/ $VELO non-lockers could also be alright, assuming they are $VELO LPs (the
only other use case for $VELO at the moment) and that sufficient emissions are
directed toward their pool.</p>
<p>25/ The (veloPrice * veloEmitted * (1 / (oldTotalSupply + 1)) formula (which
actually needs to be adjusted for the rebase!) from above merely represents a
level of interest for bribes.</p>
<p>26/ This level is not particularly an attractor however. Prices could be lower
if there too much emissions compared to projects appetite for liquidity rewards.</p>
<p>If that&#39;s not the case, the bribes total should be higher as projects compete
for these emissions.</p>
<p>27/ In fact, if the demand for incentives outpaces the $VELO emissions, this
should in theory drive the bribe per $VELO emitted close to the price of $VELO.
Or even slightly above — as there is value in the convience of a turnkey
liquidity mining solution.</p>
<p>28/ Note here that $VELO being locked has an impact. If it wasn&#39;t, then bribes
being below the level of interest above for too long (because demand for
liquidity reward is too low) would cause people to sell $VELO.</p>
<p>29/ A falling $VELO price cause the total values of emissions to fall, which
would bring it back towards demand.</p>
<p>That system would be self-regulating, which the current one isn&#39;t because of the
lock. I&#39;m not sure which one is actually better for the long-term price of the
token!</p>
<p>30/ So we&#39;ve just described a system where projects save money, lockers make
money and LPs (include $VELO LPs) make money.</p>
<p>Have we broken financial common sense? Is this a good old ponzu? Who foots the
bill?</p>
<p>31/ For one, users via fees, which accrue to the lockers. But that&#39;s far from
the whole story in the short/medium-term.</p>
<p>Instead I think most of these profits come from the value of the $VELO token
itself.</p>
<p>32/ Just like $BTC (or in fact $USD) are not &quot;backed&quot; by anything, so is $VELO.
i.e. there is no redemption guarantee beyond what you can get on the market
(within the limitation of available liquidity, underscoring again why this is so
important).</p>
<p>33/ Instead, a good tokenomics analysis must look at reflective loops,
especially under extreme conditions.</p>
<p>34/ So what could go wrong? The price could tank. (e.g. as a bear market rolls
around)</p>
<p>35/ One bad thing about $VELO (and $CRV) is that its cashflows are mostly
effectively denominated in $VELO. i.e. the willingness of projects to bribe is
proportional to the market value of of emissions. So when the $VELO price tanks,
so should bribes.</p>
<p>36/ The iron rule (in a rational world...) is that the total value of bribes
should never exceed the value of $VELO emitted through the vote of bribed
lockers (+ a small premium representing the usefulness of the service, and
eventually some inertia).</p>
<p>37/ Now if the total bribe value is lower than the emitted $VELO (through bribed
lockers), then the total bribe value does not need to decrease.</p>
<p>However I would rate this unlikely in the long term, if we consider a situation
where the price just decreased significantly.</p>
<p>38/ (Somewhat similarly, projects saving money on accumulated $VELO depends on
the value of all future emissions.)</p>
<p>39/ This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that fees are independent of $VELO
price. This could help moderate downdrafts, or at least help establish a price
zone where $VELO is &quot;cheap&quot;.</p>
<p>40/ This is a place where Velodrome (&amp; Solidly) markedly improve on Curve, as
the fees accruing to the lockers brings price-independent value to the token.</p>
<p>41/ As an interesting data point, over the past 14 days, <a href="https://dune.com/rplust/Vote-Locked-Convex-Token-(vlCVX)-Bribes">Votium bribes for
Convex lockers</a> were ~7.6M while <a href="https://dune.com/mrblock_buidl/Curve.fi">total curve fees</a>
were ~1.1M.</p>
<p>42/ Another moderating force on the downside is that projects may be driven to
accumulate when the price decreases.</p>
<p>Why would they do this?</p>
<p>43/ For one, the original thesis remains unchanged: since emissions are
denominated in $VELO, the savings remains similar given a flat price.</p>
<p>(And even better if they anticipate the price slump to be temporary.)</p>
<p>44/ The second reason is that the drop in price likely saturated the bribe
capacity it wasn&#39;t already (see &quot;iron rule&quot; above). Emissions can no longer be
purchased without overspending. Accumulating $VELO is the only avenue left to
secure discounted liquidity rewards.</p>
<p>45/ (In this case, by amortizing the initial purchase over time via the value of
future emissions.)</p>
<p>46/ So as you can see, there are some moderating factors on the downside, and no
downwards spiral type effects.</p>
<p>47/ However I don&#39;t love that returns are mostly $VELO denominated. This means
that outside of periods of very low price (where fees effectively set a floor)
and periods of accumulation, the price is mostly beholden to external forces
(macro &amp; cycles).</p>
<p>48/ That being said, it&#39;s quite possible that we are entering one such period of
accumulation as Velodrome just launched and Optimism is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>49/ There are many other interesting things I&#39;d love to think &amp; talk about on
the subject of Velodrome (e.g. how $VELO is locked as veNFT and what that
entails, or what a Convex-style layer could look like), but this is already
super long, so I&#39;ll stop here.</p>
<p>50/ I hope I did convince you that Velodrome is a good liquidity incentive
system, and that it at least deserves your attention!</p>
<p>51/ Obviously, none of this is financial advice. Don&#39;t trust what a random
internet stranger has to say, validate.</p>
<p>Disclaimers: I have small positions in both $VELO and $CRV/$CVX. I also worked
with the Velodrome team in my capacity as an OP Labs employee.</p>
