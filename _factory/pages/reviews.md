I consume a lot of media, and I've found it valuable to keep track of my
thoughts about them are. I started only reviewing anime (something I got into at
a relatively late age) and over time expanded to more "stuff".

Let's be honest, I'm not going to win any critical review awards. In fact, many
of these reviews are downright bad. But I enjoy going back and seeing what I
thought and what was saliant back when I first watched/read the thing. And if
I'm going to do it for me, I might as well force it on you as well.

Single (short) reviews:

- [Hot Take: Gurren Lagann](/gurren-lagann-reaction)
- [Reflets d'Acide: It's (Finally) Over](/reflets-d-acides-fini)

I also wrote a number of longer book summaries which I found particularly
insightful:

- [Patterns of Software: Highlights](/patterns-of-software)
- [My Favorite Quotes from "Hell Yeah Or No"](/hell-yeah)
- [My Favorite Quotes from "Your Music and Your People"](/your-music)

I occassionally like to read book summaries instead of the book itself, when I
have doubts about it being worth my time. I wrote about [where to find these
summaries](/book-summaries).
