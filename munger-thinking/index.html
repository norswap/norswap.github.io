      <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2017</span>
<p>This is post 2/4 in <a href="/munger">a series about Charlie Munger&#39;s wisdom</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t Try to be Smart, Avoid Idiocy</strong></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by
trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very
intelligent. There must be some wisdom in the folk saying &quot;It’s the strong
swimmers who drown.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>We try to profit from always remembering the obvious than from grasping the
esoteric.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Other people are trying to be smart, all I’m trying to be is non-idiotic. I’ve
found that’s all you have to do to get ahead in life, be non-idiotic and live
a long time. It’s harder to be non-idiotic than most people think.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Organized common (or uncommon) sense is an enormously powerful tool. There are
huge dangers with computers. People calculate too much and think too little.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Use of the scientific method and effective checklists minimizes errors and
omissions.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t overlook the obvious by drowning in minutiae.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>Restrict Yourself to your Circle of Competence</strong></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawning of wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>If we have a strength, it is in recognizing when we are operating well within
our circle of competence and when we are approaching the perimeter.<br>— Warren Buffett</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Only in fairy tales are emperors told they are naked.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>If you try to predict the future of everything, you attempt too much. You’re
going to fail through lack of specialisation.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Mimicking the herd, invites regression to the mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Above all, never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person
to fool.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are, If you play games where
other people have the aptitudes and you don&#39;t, you&#39;re going to lose.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>Invert, Always Invert</strong></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it
backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where don’t we want to go,
and how do you get there? Instead of looking for success, make a list of how
to fail instead. Tell me where I’m going to die, that is, so I don’t go there.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>I was greatly helped in my quest by two turns of mind. First, I had long
looked for insight by inversion in the intense manner counseled by the great
algebraist, Jacobi: &quot;Invert, always invert.&quot; I sought good judgment mostly by
collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such
outcomes. Second, I became so avid a collector of instances of bad judgement
that I paid no attention to boundaries between professional territories.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>Model Thinking</strong></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as multiple factors shape almost every system, multiple models from a
variety of disciplines, applied with fluency, are needed to understand that
system.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important thing to keep in mind is the idea that especially big forces
often come out of these one hundred models. When several models combine, you get
lollapalooza effects; this is when two, three, or four forces are all operating
in the same direction. And, frequently, you dont get simple addition. It&#39;s often
like a critical mass in physics where you get a nuclear explosion if you get to
a certain point of mass - and you dont ger anything much worth seeing if you
don&#39;t reach the mass. Sometimes the forces just add like ordinary quantities and
sometimes they combine on a breakpoint or critical-mass basis.</p>
<p>More commonly, the forces coming out of these one hundred models are
conflicting to some extent. And you get huge, miserable tradeoffs. But if you
can&#39;t think in terms of tradeoffs and recognize tradeoffs in what you&#39;re
dealing with, you&#39;re a horse&#39;s patoot. You clearly are a danger to the rest of
the people when serious thinking is being done. You have to recognize how
these things combine.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve long believed that a certain system - which almost any intelligent person
can learn - works way better than the systems that most people use. What you
need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And, with that system,
things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Especially important examples of these models include the redundancy/backup
system model from engineering, the compound interest model from mathematics,
the breakpoint / tipping-moment / autocatalysis models from physics and
chemistry, the modern Darwinian synthesis model from biology, and cognitive
misjudgment models from psychology.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I&#39;ve gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First,
what are the factors that really govern the interests invoked, rationally
considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain
at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions in various ways -
which, by and large, are useful - but which often malfunction?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>How can smart people so often be wrong? They don&#39;t do what I&#39;m telling you to
do: use a checklist to be sure you get all the main models and use them
together in a multimodular way.</p>
