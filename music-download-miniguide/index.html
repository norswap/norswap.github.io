      <h1 class="post-title">Music Download Miniguide</h1>
      <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2017</span>
<p>Nowadays, it is easier than ever to listen to music: just use <a href="https://play.spotify.com">Spotify</a> or
<a href="http://www.deezer.com/">Deezer</a>, amongst others.</p>
<p>Call me old-fashioned, but I don&#39;t like to be dependent on an internet
connection. So let&#39;s get started!</p>
<h2 id="single-tracks">Single Tracks</h2>
<h3 id="youtube">Youtube</h3>
<p>This is the option I use most often, because it is so damn easy. Go on <a href="http://www.deezer.com/en/">YouTube</a>,
then use the website <a href="http://www.flvto.biz/">flvto</a>. Or even better, download
their <a href="http://www.flvto.biz/youtube-downloader/">desktop app</a> for Windows/OSX which enables HD downloads,
and automatic detection of YouTube URLs in the clipboard. They also
have <a href="http://www.flvto.biz/addon/">addons</a> for most browsers.</p>
<p>Another alternative is <a href="http://www.youtube-mp3.org">youtube-mp3</a>, which also has Firefox and Chrome <a href="http://www.youtube-mp3.org/addons">addons</a></p>
<p>The downside of downloading from YouTube is that quality tends to be somewhat
variable. I&#39;m no audiophile and so if it sounds good to me, I download it.</p>
<h3 id="songr">Songr</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.xamasoft.com/songr/">Songr</a> is an app that searches a bunch of websites (include <a href="http://groovesharks.org/">Grooveshark</a> and
<a href="http://pleer.net/">Prostopleer</a>) for MP3 downloads. I don&#39;t use it very much, YouTube + flvto is
easier, and the options in the next section are more comprehensive. Nevertheless
it has been around for a while, and it&#39;s good to know that it is available.</p>
<h2 id="full-albums--single-tracks">Full Albums (&amp; Single Tracks)</h2>
<h3 id="spotiload-formerly-spotify-vk-downloader">Spotiload (formerly Spotify VK Downloader)</h3>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotiload-former-spotify/baggnalhgbpeanbhedjlbndhjgmimmhl">Spotiload</a> is a chrome extension that lets you download songs from Spotify.
Except it doesn&#39;t, really. Instead, you have to be logged on the Russian social
network <a href="https://vk.com/">VK.com</a>, which for some reason holds a huge collection of MP3s. You&#39;ll
then be able to search for the music you&#39;re listening to on Spotify and download
it from VK.</p>
<p>A small pain point is that you can only download songs 4 at at time, so you
cannot leave you album download unattended. It has also happened to me that
Spotiload couldn&#39;t find some songs on VK (the song wasn&#39;t on YouTube either, but
I finally got it from Deezer). That should be exceedingly rare however.</p>
<p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be any reliable way to download music from Spotify itself
at the time of writing. VK, howver, doesn&#39;t seem very intent to crack down on
illegal downloads, so this seems like a good option for now.</p>
<h3 id="deezer-downloader">Deezer Downloader</h3>
<p>Here is a downloader for Deezer called <a href="https://github.com/Deezloader/Deezloader">Deezloader</a>. It actually doesn&#39;t work
as-is (you can&#39;t log into your Deezer account), you&#39;ll need to apply <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/921xiw/deezer_api/e33hpsq/">this fix</a> first.</p>
<p>The above was updated in May 2018. When I first wrote this post, I said
something to the effect that I wasn&#39;t confident that the downloader I
recommended then would keep working for very long. And indeed, I&#39;ve had to
update (I should have updated more than once, but got lazy).</p>
<p>I still think no tool in this niche is perenne, and so, if you find yourself
needing a Deezer downloader or any other such tool, a good place to search is
the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/">Piracy sub-reddit</a>.</p>
<p>However, in the current state of things, Deezloader is my tool of choice for
high-quality track and albums downloads.</p>
<h3 id="private-bittorrent-trackers">Private BitTorrent Trackers</h3>
<p>In general, BitTorrent is lousy for album downloads. However, there exist
specialized trackers where you can find all the music you want. If only it was
that easy...</p>
<p>First, these trackers usually require you to be invited by an existing member.
Sometimes, you can pass an <a href="https://interview.passtheheadphones.me/index.shtml">interview</a> (I kid you not) to be invited.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;re invited, you&#39;re required to maintain a positive seed ratio (upload
as much as you download). That doesn&#39;t seem like much, but it can actually be
pretty challenging. First because everyone is trying to maintain/improve their
ratio, so there is more upload capacity than demand. Second, because when you
are starting out, you will have nothing to upload! Usually you can download
without uploading at the beginning, to get a starting stash. Still, that doesn&#39;t
always suffice. Some trackers have <em>freeleech</em> albums where downloads don&#39;t count
towards your ratio, but uploads do, the goal being to generate some easy upload
for users. Incidentally this is also why many people use <em>seeboxes</em> (servers
dedicated to torrenting): those have high upload bandwidth, so you can increase
your upload faster.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a bit of a crazy world, and I haven&#39;t found the need to engage in this
sillyness so far, but you never know.</p>
<p>It seems that the best option currently is <a href="https://passtheheadphones.me/">Pass The Headphones</a> and <a href="https://apollo.rip/">Apollo</a>
(formerly Xanax). Over the years, the best options have been OiNK, What.cd and
Waffles.cd. Some of these grew quite famous, but ultimately they all closed or
were closed.</p>
<p>The definitive source of info about private trackers is the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/">Trackers
sub-reddit</a>.</p>
