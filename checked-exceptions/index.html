      <h1 class="post-title">In Defence of Checked Exceptions</h1>
      <span class="post-date">03 Oct 2015</span>
<p>I had a minor epiphany recently. I realized that checked exceptions are great.
Until then I supported the hip opinion that checked exceptions are a design
mistakes, and that all exceptions should be unchecked.</p>
<p>The first step on my path to enlightenment was to realize the different use
cases for checked and unchecked exceptions. Java Practices <a href="http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=129">says it best</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unchecked exceptions represent defects in the program (bugs) - often invalid
    arguments passed to a non-private method. To quote from The Java Programming
    Language, by Gosling, Arnold, and Holmes: &quot;Unchecked runtime exceptions
    represent conditions that, generally speaking, reflect errors in your
    program&#39;s logic and cannot be reasonably recovered from at run time.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Checked exceptions represent invalid conditions in areas outside the
    immediate control of the program (invalid user input, database problems,
    network outages, absent files).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideally, all unchecked exceptions can be removed from your program without
causing problems. They are just a debugging aid in pinpointing what went wrong
when you made a mistake. Under this assumption, unchecked exceptions should
never be handled: the program is incorrect and should crash and burn. Or at
least, the component (~ a blob of features) should. It&#39;s good form to insulate
other components from the failure of a component, if they can still perform
usefully without it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can&#39;t prevent checked exceptions from occuring, they are
outside your sphere of control. Hence the need to ensure that are handled
correctly.</p>
<p>This seems to make sense. So why are people so fiercely opposed to checked
exceptions?</p>
<p>Well imagine that you are writing some code, and you make a call to a method
that throws a checked exception. You have two choices: add a <code>throws</code> clause to
your method, or wrap the method call in a try-catch block. The right thing to do
is to use try-catch if you can handle the exception at that level, otherwise to
add a <code>throws</code> clause. In practice, the <code>throws</code> clause is almost always the
right thing to do. Yet, adding a <code>throws</code> clause is tedious, because it must be
propagated to all the callers of the current method. It&#39;s much easier to add a
try-catch block even though there&#39;s nothing we can do about the exception, and
so ignore it silently, leading to a loss of information in case of failure.</p>
<p>People who oppose exceptions have either performed this kind of abuse, or have
been bitten by the consequences of other people doing it. I am not making this
up, it&#39;s quite obvious from pieces like <a href="http://www.mindview.net/Etc/Discussions/CheckedExceptions">this one</a> and it&#39;s explained in
great length <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/614494/298664">here</a>.</p>
<p>Summarized: people don&#39;t want exceptions because they are going to be abused by
lazy programmers.</p>
<p>I can also think of another reason why exceptions might be frustrating to use:
people don&#39;t understand the distinction between checked and unchecked exceptions
as spelled out above, and so create frustrating APIs. Even Sun has been guilty
of this: should <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NoSuchMethodException.html">NoSuchMethodException</a> really be a checked exception?
Probably not.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#39;ll note that it&#39;s sometimes allowable to cheat a little bit. If
you&#39;re writing a component with a well-delimited interface, you could for
instance eschew checked exceptions if all the exceptions are going to be handled
at the API boundary and no cleanup needs to be performed. You&#39;re trading off
some safety for some typing. Just be aware that you are making the trade-off.</p>
<p>In conclusion, do use checked exception, but use them properly: define checked
exceptions only for areas outside the programmer&#39;s control; and don&#39;t silently
swallow checked exceptions.</p>
