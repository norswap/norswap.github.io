      <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2018</span>
<p>Previously: <a href="/weight-training">Starting Weight Training</a></p>
<h2 id="progression">Progression</h2>
<p>The <a href="/weight-training">first post</a> was written two months after I started training. It&#39;s now been
about 7 months. The time the post was written ended up being somewhat
unfortunate, because I almost immediately had to deload some of my lifts. My
squat form was slightly subpar, and I deloaded the row and the bench press as
part of the program: if you can&#39;t progress three times straight, you deload.
Some form tweaks were also applied.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what total progress looks like. The screencap in <a href="/weight-training">last post</a>
was taken around the 19th of May.</p>
<p><img src="/weight-training-2/weights.png" alt="Graph of weight lifted over time."></p>
<p>You can see dips for the previously mentionned lifts in between the 11 May and
22 June bars. You should ignore the sharp dips right after the 22 June bar —
that&#39;s an anomaly that occured because I changed the weights one day to make up
for having only one hour to spend at the gym.</p>
<p>Something interesting is the huge barbell row dip. In short, I was doing barbell
row completely wrong. Part of the problem is my size: for proper form (back
horizontal) I&#39;m forced to almost press my stomach to my tights, which I wasnt
doing. It&#39;s also possible that lack of strength in my upper back caused other
muscles to compensate. Anyway, I finally feel like I &quot;get&quot; the exercise and I
can feel its effects, whereas previously it seemed pointless, too easy, and the
form was hard to judge.</p>
<p>All other dips in the graph are simply the normal &quot;deload on failure&quot; mechanism
kicking in. I particularly remember the squat one towards the end, which
occurred after I came back from my Ireland trip.</p>
<p>Not represented in the graph, but highly relevant is the fact that I switched to
3x5 (down from 5x5) on the squat and on the bench press, at the beginning of
this month. It&#39;s what the Stronglift program <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#321553215312153">advises</a>. In fact, had I read that
part carefully, I might have done it earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is one way to know if it’s time to switch from 5×5 to 3×5. If your
workouts are taking two hours because you have to rest 10mins between sets to
get 5×5… you’re probably overdoing it. Don’t get stubborn about sticking with
5×5. Switch to 3×5 so you can continue to make progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I only ever did 3-4 mins rests between sets (and 5 on failure), but my workouts
did (and honestly still do) take 2 hours. I progressed though, so it might have
been for the best that I sticked to 5x5.</p>
<p>Another part that caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5×5 doesn’t work forever. Nothing does. The stronger you get, the heavier the
weights you can lift, and thus the bigger the stress of each 5×5 workout. That
stress eventually becomes too big for your body to recover from by the next
workout. You don’t get stronger in time so you fail reps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that was exactly the situation in September, in fact it had been for some
time (at least one month). I was feeling physically quite tired a lot of the
time. Not really like brain fog, but much more like I&#39;d been doing hard manual
labor all day.</p>
<p>Switching to 3x5 helped, but I took it further, and since two weeks I&#39;m only
doing two workouts a week instead of three. With three workouts I was feeling I
really didn&#39;t have enough time to recover and consolidate my gains — especially
when there was only one resting day in between workouts, and especially on the
squat which is done on every workout. I&#39;m feeling pretty good about this right
now (not to mention the time savings), but we&#39;ll see how it works out in the
long run.</p>
<h2 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h2>
<p>At some point, I really realized I needed to eat more to be able to progress.
After some experiments, I&#39;ve settled on taking bigger dinners (which were
usually lighter for me), as well as occasionally indulging in some more proteins
at lunch. I also try to be more consistently taking protein shakes twice a day.</p>
<p>Speaking about protein shakes, I&#39;ve switched to Optimum Nutrition <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/OPTIMUM-NUTRITION-Standard-Prot%C3%A9ine-Chocolat/dp/B000QSNYGI">Gold Standard
Whey</a>, double chocolate flavor, after a friend recommended it to me. I mix that
with milk, and the result is that it tastes a bit like milk with cocoa powder.
Finally, proteins that don&#39;t taste FOUL. Thanks god.</p>
<p>Something disappointing regarding nutrition is that since I started lifting, it
seems like my body fat percentage didn&#39;t really move. I didn&#39;t measure it with
any precision, but while it&#39;s clear I have more muscles, it isn&#39;t clear at all
that I have less fat. This is annoying, because my primary objective was to look
better... I&#39;ve drifted from that somewhat (discussion in the next section) but
it would be cool if I could do something about it without jeopardizing muscle
gains too much.</p>
<p>My current idea is to try some form of intermittent fasting (IF). I almost
already do an 8/16 IF split where I eat only during at 8 hour window
(12:00-20:00), but I&#39;m not being strict about it — I usually have some fruits or
nuts in the morning, dessert in the evening, and protein shakes of course. I
want to try being extra strict and see if it enables some fat loss.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#39;t work, I might try another of IF, which I&#39;ll refer to as &quot;day
fasting&quot;: fast one or more whole day in the week. Some popular approaches are
alternate-day fasting (but that&#39;s too much while doing the gym) and <a href="https://leangains.com/">Leangains</a>
(twice a week + additional dietetic advice). I&#39;d just do a single day with no
more constraints honestly.</p>
<p>And if <em>that</em> does not work, I guess I&#39;ll need to revert to theh good old &quot;cut&quot;:
losing fat while preventing muscle loss. Apparently it&#39;s much harder to gain
muscle than to prevent the loss of already existing muscle.</p>
<h2 id="sleep">Sleep</h2>
<p>During the period where I was feeling very tired, I started noticing a few
effects that would definitely help my gym performance. Having some caffeine in
the morning, and some light breakfast (e.g. a fruit and a toast) before lifting
helped somewhat. Lifting in the afternoon rather than in the morning helped more
(and I&#39;m now usually lifting Wednesday and Sunday afternoon). But most of all, a
good night sleep was necessary: a short night of sleep would ruin my chances at
breaking through a plateau.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started tracking my sleep using the <a href="https://sleep.urbandroid.org/introducing-sonar-as-sensor/">sonar tech</a> of the application <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep">Sleep
as Android</a>. From my research on the topic, the tracking of sleep phases doesn&#39;t
really seem to be accurate. However, using the app has been an effective
incentive to get my average time in bed to 8 hours / night over the past month.</p>
<p>I did an experience a couple years ago — while writing my master thesis — where
I would not set any alarm clock and sleep as long as my body would require for a
few months. The results was that after a brief adjustment period where I sleeped
A LOT, I ended up sleeping 9 hours every night. Which is still a lot more than
most people get. This doesn&#39;t seem to have changed (or maybe has worsened), as
even when I sleep 8.5 hours, I never wake up naturally but always from my alarm
clock.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping I can try to increase my sleep even further, since apparently that&#39;s
what I need. It seems to help the lifting anyhow, at least when combined with
the switch to a twice-a-week rythm.</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives?</h2>
<p>In my last post, I set some objectives after which to re-evaluate my training
regimen. Namely: 96kg on squat, 72kg on bench press, 120kg on deadlift and 48kg
on overhead press. I&#39;ve blown past all of those, and haven&#39;t changed.</p>
<p>One reason is &quot;don&#39;t change something that works&quot; and the program kept working
for me.</p>
<p>However, one of my initial objectives was to look better. And I did look better
when I wrote last post compared to two months prior, and I do look even better
now. But it&#39;s a quite subtle improvement for the amount of work put in.</p>
<p>The problem is two-fold: first, I have too much fat and that hinders muscle
definition; second, I experience relatively little muscle hypertrophy (my
muscles are strong, but not that big).</p>
<p>(However, I&#39;ll note my weight gains have been relatively steady, following an
initial burst. I&#39;m now at 86kg.)</p>
<p>There are well-known easy solutions for those things: go into a cut to get rid
of the fat (cf. last section) and switch to a hypertrophy/bodybuilding program
for muscle growth.</p>
<p>The thing is... I have some aversion to switching from the path delineated by
the program and its advanced versions. One reason might be
familiarity/change-aversion. Another is that I really enjoy constantly beating
my records and seeing the numbers go up. I&#39;m also quite curious. How far can I
go? If I stop on the strength training path, will I ever be able to come back
and see? Doubtful.</p>
<p>I guess I could alternate hypertrophy and strength training, at least experiment
to see if it&#39;s a viable strategy. But I&#39;m still progressing with the current
strategy, and it has well-defined changes to implement in case I stall anyway
(go to 3x5 than 3x3, switch to <a href="https://stronglifts.com/madcow-5x5/">Madcow</a>, switch to <a href="https://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-advanced-strength-muscle-building-training-program/">StrongLifts advanced</a>,
switch to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/recommended_routines">5/3/1</a>).</p>
<p>The trade-off outlined before me is simple: risk being unoptimal — maybe I would
look better and be stronger faster if I alternated hypertrophy with strength
training; or risk completely wasting my time and jeopardize my motivation — if I
blow the hypertrophy approach or it doesn&#39;t end up being beneficial for my
strength.</p>
<p>For now I&#39;m staying on the straigth and narrow, but I&#39;m open to re-evaluate when
the time comes.</p>
