<p>Every programmer occasionally, when nobody’s home, turns off the lights, pours a
glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on
their computer. It’s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote
it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the
lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the
rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in
the world.</p>
<p>This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and
variables. It’s concise. It doesn’t do anything obviously stupid. It has never
had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one,
mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person,
and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over
thirty.</p>
<p>Every programmer starts out writing some perfect little snowflake like this.
Then they’re told on Friday they need to have six hundred snowflakes written by
Tuesday, so they cheat a bit here and there and maybe copy a few snowflakes and
try to stick them together or they have to ask a coworker to work on one who
melts it and then all the programmers’ snowflakes get dumped together in some
inscrutable shape and somebody leans a Picasso on it because nobody wants to see
the cat urine soaking into all your broken snowflakes melting in the light of
day. Next week, everybody shovels more snow on it to keep the Picasso from
falling over.</p>
