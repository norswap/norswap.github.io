It's been a crazy year. I was already crazy [back in March](/ragged), but
against my better judgement, I (thankfully!) doubled down.

In June, I took a leave from my Job at Oracle to take part in the [Ethereum Core
Developer Apprenticeship][cdap] for four months. I learned a ton — here's [a
recap] of what I did there.

By the end of the program, I was sold, and I joined [Optimism] to work on
scaling the Ethereum blockchain. My first task there will be to help [specify
and prototype][specs] the new version of the Optimistic Ethereum rollup. It's
been a blast so far!

Expect more content soon, especially blockchain-related. If you hate blockchains
— I'm so sorry.
