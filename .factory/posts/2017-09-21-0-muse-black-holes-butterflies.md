And now, for something completely different.

I have an ongoing project of going through my considerable music library to
isolate, rank and categorize its best tracks.

When the band Muse came under the microscope, I was very tempted to make a
compilation of my favourite tracks; and so I did just that.

Muse occupies a special place in my musical pantheon. I realized a few years ago
that I liked pretty much everything that they put out, which for me happens very
rarely. I'm more inclined to listen to a hodge podge of individual tracks rather
than to complete albums.

I wanted this compilation to feel like a real album. Therefore it had to have
some kind of thematical consistency, some sense of continuity, and a pleasant
pacing. Oh, and it had to fit on a 80 minutes CD! I'm pleased with the result,
and I hope you can enjoy it too.

Without further ado, [the album][listen].

Now for some trivia about the making of the pie...

### Title

I gave the album the title *Black Holes & Butterflies*, a mash up of the
track title *Butterflies & Hurricanes* and the album title *Black Holes &
Revelations* (a line from the song *Starlight*). The title can be interpreted in
many different ways, but doesn't really have any fixed meaning.

At some point, I hesitated to call the album *Uprising*, as the story told by
the songs can be interpreted as a journey of dissension. However, Muse already
has track called *Uprising*, which doesn't feature on this album. And in the
end, the poetry of *Black Holes & Butterflies* quite rightfully won out.

### Track Origin

Let's look at the tracks' original albums:

```
Black Holes & Revelations   x4 (02, 08, 09, 11)
Absolution                  x4 (06, 10, 12, 13)
Origin of Symmetry          x3 (01, 07, 14)
The Resistance              x2 (03, 04)
The 2nd Law                 x1 (05)
```

If I had to make a ranking of my favourite Muse albums:

1. Black Holes and Revelations (2006)
2. Absolution (2003)
3. Origin of Symmetry (2001)
3. The Resistance (2009)
4. Showbiz (1999)
5. The 2nd Law (2012)
6. Drones (2015)

This is more or less consistent with the songs' origin, with *Drones* not
featuring at all. Muse's debut album *Showbiz* doesn't feature either.
Thematically and musically, I feel it is rather distinct to the other albums:
it's a bit as if it happened before Muse found it's own grandiose
conspiracy-fueled self.

### Discarded Tracks

Now for some tracks I really like but that didn't make the cut:

- Bliss (Origin of Symmetry)
- Sing for Absolution (Absolution)
- Apocalypse Please (Absolution)
- Stockholm Syndrome (Absolution)
- Ruled By Secrecy (Absolution)
- United States of Eurasia (The Resistance)
- Follow Me (The 2nd Law)
- Panic Station (The 2nd Law)
- Dead Inside (Drones)
- Mercy (Drones)

For most of them, the reason is pretty simple: they didn't fit musically,
thematically, or both.

*Sing for Absolution* is probably the track I would have liked to include most.
While it's super powerful, the album isn't really about regrets, but more about
strife. It always looks forward, not backward.

*Apocalypse Please* could have been included, but it's an ending track, and the
ending is already strong, between *Thoughts of a Dying Atheist* and *Time is
Running Out*. I was also keen to have *Feeling Good* as final track, to end on
an ethereal fresh note. Nevertheless, this would definitely have been included
if not for the time restriction.

*Ruled by Secrecy* would have been a strong contender if I needed a lull
somewhere in the album (which would have made a lot of sense if it had been
longer). Finally, *Stockholm Syndrome* would have blended in just fine, but it
was just a weaker candidate all around.

### Cover Art

I actually made two versions of the cover art: the one you can see on the
youtube videos and just below, and the one towards the top of the article.

[cover2]: /posts/muse-black-holes-butterflies/cover2.jpg

The one below I found by searching for pictures of black holes. I used it to
upload the videos. But then I found the second picture, which depicts the
[butterfly nebula]. I couldn't resist the fact that it linked both compoments of
the album title, and it looks pretty neat too.
