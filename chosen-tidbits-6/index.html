instead. Remember that directional advice (e.g., “be more …”) <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/">may need to be
reversed</a> before consumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If an outcome has probability 1/N for each &quot;attempt&quot;, and it is attempted N
times, the probability it will occur at least once stabilizes at 0.62 as N
increases.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you throw N balls randomly (independently and one at a time) into N
buckets. On average, a bit over a third (1/e) of the buckets will stay empty, a
bit over a third (1/e again) will have exactly one ball, and the remaining
quarter or so (1 − 2/e) will contain multiple balls.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If a group of things are randomly shuffled, a bit of over a third (1/e) of the
time there’ll be no fixed points (something that lands in the same position), a
bit of over a third (1/e) of the time there’ll be just one fixed point, and the
remaining quarter or so of the time there’ll be two or more.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s look at the common “loot box” mechanism. Specifically, suppose there are
10 collector items (say, one for each hero in a franchise) that are sold in
blind boxes. Let’s take the fairest case in which there are no rare items and
each item has an equal 1/10 chance of being in a given box. How many boxes will a
collector buy on average before getting a complete set? This is the called the
coupon collector’s problem, and for 10 items the answer is about 29.</p>
<p>The answer to the coupon collector’s problem is a bit more than N * ln(N) (add N/2
for some more accuracy).</p>
<p>The coupon collector’s problem hints at why the loot box mechanism is so
powerful. The N balls in N buckets rule tells us that the collector will have
about two thirds of the items after buying 10 boxes. It feels like the collector
is most of the way there, and it would be a shame to give up and let so much
progress go to waste, but actually 10 boxes is only about a third of the
expected number of boxes needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ergodicity: A die rolled 100 times has equal probabilities to 100 dice rolled
once; rolling a die is “ergodic”. But if the die gets chipped after 10 throws
so it’s likelier to roll 4, then 1 die 100 times =/= 100 dice once
(non-ergodic). Many treat non-ergodic systems as ergodic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simpson’s Paradox: A trend can appear in groups of data but disappear when these
groups are combined. This effect can easily be exploited by limiting a dataset
so that it shows exactly what one wants it to show. Thus: beware of even the
strongest correlations. (<a href="https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1225561191470260227">illustration</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Condorcet Paradox: a special instance of Simpson’s paradox applied to elections,
in which a populace prefers candidate A to candidate B, candidate B to C, and
yet candidate C to A. This occurs because the majority that favors C is
misleadingly divided among different groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Concept Creep: As a social issue such as racism or sexual harassment becomes
rarer, people react by expanding their definition of it, creating the illusion
that the issue is actually getting worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Streetlight Effect: People tend to get their information from where it’s easiest
to look.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Woozle Effect: An article makes a claim without evidence, is then cited by
another, which is cited by another, and so on, until the range of citations
creates the impression that the claim has evidence, when really all articles are
citing the same uncorroborated source.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tocqueville Paradox: As the living standards in a society rise, the people’s
expectations of the society rise with it. The rise in expectations eventually
surpasses the rise in living standards, inevitably resulting in disaffection
(and sometimes populist uprisings).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nirvana Fallacy: When people reject a thing because it compares unfavorably to
an ideal that in reality is unattainable. E.g. condemning capitalism due to
the superiority of imagined socialism, condemning ruthlessness in war due to
imagining humane (but unrealistic) ways to win.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve noticed that many of the most persistent childhood traumas related to being
made to feel unwanted, a burden, the &quot;bad&quot; one. I think they may persist as
&quot;chronic mental illness&quot; because being sick doesn&#39;t heal the wound of being a
burden — being <em>the healer</em> does</p>
<p>I sincerely believe that many western communities are now suffering not for lack
of services to be received by hurting people, but for lack of services to be
<em>provided</em> by hurting people.</p>
<p>Counterintuitive as it is, next time someone around you is struggling with
living in their own head, don&#39;t ask how you can help; ask them to help you. If
they don&#39;t, or they flake, just keep asking for small things. Don&#39;t pressure or
punish for lack of follow-through, just ask</p>
<p><em>&quot;You&#39;re not so broken that we don&#39;t need you&quot;</em> is something that has to be
lived to be believed</p>

<p>If it is true that… many of our beliefs are actually <em>external</em> to our internal
world, off-loaded on to the internet, books, authorities we identify with, etc…
then it might be that the project of &#39;debunking&#39; is of limited value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that <em>identification</em> with many institutions… is every bit as much a
mechanism that binds people to oppressive systems as conscious belief… a major
strategy for undermining certain social formations would consist in the question
of how to produce <em>disidentification</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11783">Concept: Kayfabe</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because professional wrestling is a simulated sport, all competitors who face
each other in the ring are actually close collaborators who must form a closed
system (called &quot;a promotion&quot;) sealed against outsiders. With external
competitors generally excluded, antagonists are chosen from within the promotion
and their ritualized battles are largely negotiated, choreographed, and
rehearsed at a significantly decreased risk of injury or death. With outcomes
predetermined under Kayfabe, betrayal in wrestling comes not from engaging in
unsportsmanlike conduct, but by the surprise appearance of actual sporting
behavior. Such unwelcome sportsmanship which &quot;breaks Kayfabe&quot; is called
&quot;shooting&quot; to distinguish it from the expected scripted deception called
&quot;working&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[Wrestling evolved out of &quot;catch&quot;.] Typical matches could last hours with no
satisfying action, or end suddenly with crippling injuries to a promising
athlete in whom much had been invested. This highlighted the close
relationship between two paradoxical risks which define the category of
activity which wrestling shares with other human spheres:</p>
<p>A) Occasional but Extreme Peril for the participants.
B) General: Monotony for both audience and participants.</p>
<p>Kayfabrication (the process of transition from reality towards Kayfabe) arises
out of attempts to deliver a dependably engaging product for a mass audience
while removing the unpredictable upheavals that imperil participants. As such
Kayfabrication is a dependable feature of many of our most important systems
which share the above two characteristics such as war, finance, love, politics
and science.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the point Kayfabe was forced to own up to the fact that professional
wrestling contained no sport whatsoever, it did more than avoid being regulated
and taxed into oblivion. Wrestling discovered the unthinkable: its audience did
not seem to require even a thin veneer of realism. Professional wrestling had
come full circle to its honest origins by at last moving the responsibility for
deception off of the shoulders of the performers and into the willing minds of
the audience.</p>
<p>Kayfabe, it appears, is a dish best served client-side.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27181">Concept: Russell Conjugation</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the theory goes, it is not that we don’t have our own opinions so much as
that we have too many contradictory ones, and it is generally our emotional
state alone which determines on which ones we will predicate action or inaction.</p>
<p>Russell Conjugation (or “emotive conjugation”) is a presently obscure
construction from linguistics, psychology and rhetoric which demonstrates how
our rational minds are shielded from understanding the junior role factual
information generally plays relative to empathy in our formation of opinions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Where words can be considered “synonyms” if they carry the same factual content
(I) regardless of the emotional content (II). This however leads to the peculiar
effect that the synonyms for a positive word like “whistle-blower” cannot be
used in its place as they are almost universally negative (with “snitch,”
“fink,” “tattletale” being representative examples). This is our first clue that
something is wrong, or at least incomplete with our concept of synonym requiring
an upgrade to distinguish words that may be content synonyms but emotional
antonyms.</p>

Die</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like the student and other forms of personal debt that prepare undergraduates
to say two words — &quot;Yes, boss&quot; — the ideal of the entrepreneurial self serves
a fundamentally disciplinary function: reinforcing the precarious nature of
work in today’s digitalized, low-wage, precariously employed, and increasingly
automated capitalism, one in which you are casually expendable and which
places a premium on everlasting metamorphosis: upgrade your skills, your
profile, your resume. But don’t worry, complain, or God help you, call a
union: losing your job or seeing your skill set rendered obsolescent is an
opportunity for &quot;growth,&quot; creativity, empowerment. When your own exploitation
can be recast as a project rather than a problem—a source of fulfillment
rather than an instance of injustice—then solidarity with others can be
vilified as conformism, the herd instinct of normies, the last refuge of
losers and mediocrities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I asked him why he bet on Trump, he said he didn&#39;t really understand
American politics, but that it seemed extremely complicated, with random things
like whether it rains in certain parts of Pennsylvania potentially being
important. If it&#39;s extremely complicated and arbitrary, then it&#39;s probably also
hard to model. The projections he saw had the most likely outcome being a
moderate win by Hilary, but since he didn&#39;t trust the models, he figured the
value was in the tails: the models are likely off, which likely affects the
tails more than the mean. So a landslide win by Hilary or a Trump victory seemed
undervalued by gambling markets. He wished he could hedge his bets by betting on
both outcomes (as opposed to a moderate Hilary win), but the only option he had
was to bet on Trump to win.</p>
<p>This logic has stuck with me ever since: in the face of large uncertainty, we&#39;re
probably getting the tails wrong more than the mean. The value is in the tails.</p>

<p>You can decide what state of affairs counts as neutral, and what counts as
positive or negative.</p>
<p>e.g. animal suffering: you can define the zero point as &quot;animal shouldn&#39;t suffer
more than if humans were there&quot; and if you accept it, that makes you a monster.
You could frame the zero point as the current situation, and every improvement
you make as a net gain.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A society has the following rules:</p>
<p>— Everyone must publicly electro-shock themselves 8 hours per day.</p>
<p>— If you see someone not shocking themselves then you must kill them</p>
<p>— Anyone who violates the second rule must also be killed. The same is true for
  all meta levels. Non-killers of non-killers of ... of non-shockers must be
  killed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This equilibrium can get locked in even if every single person dislikes it. I
think similar but weaker dynamics apply all the time in normal life. Why is
there so much hyperbolic hate direct against furries?</p>
<p>Most are people are very repressed. Society has a norm that you need to keep
‘low status’ or ‘cringey’ aspects of yourself private. Furries often violate
these norms. People feel the urge to punish them. And people often feel
uncomfortable even being seen as being tolerant. Afterall tolerators are at risk
too!</p>
<p>I don’t claim this is the only dynamic at play. People also like to look down on
official low-status groups to feel better about themselves. Notably, even if
people don’t intrinsically want to punish non-shockers may still hate them. If
you let me see you not shocking yourself now you have put me at risk unless I
punish you!</p>

<p>I’ve had several conversations with friends who’ve been incapacitated by the
burdensome bullshit obligation to Have A Meaningful Life / Be Remembered / Do

<p>It strikes me as socially inherited bloatware that causes tedious lag, which
ironically prevents you from being awesome. When people say things like “just be

bloatware.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wonderfully, it seems to me that lots of people who end up Doing Important Work
often got there by being playful and curious. Richard Feynman, for example, got
his Nobel prize from piddling around with spinning plates. And the point isn’t
to get the Nobel prize, the point is to enjoy the piddling.</p>
