      <h1 class="post-title">One Year of Weightlifting</h1>
      <span class="post-date">12 May 2019</span>
<p>Previously: <a href="/weight-training">Starting Weight Training</a>, <a href="/weight-training-2">More Weightlifting
Observations</a></p>
<p>Been lifting for more than one year now! So what&#39;s new compared to last time?</p>
<p>The last post ended in me saying training got me tired and switching to training
only twice a week instead of three. This ended up lasting a bit less than three
months until early-January, and in retrospect, it was a mistake. I probably
should have done some kind of <a href="https://builtwithscience.com/deload-week/">deload week</a> instead and (a) eaten more, (b)
slept more. More on this later. It&#39;s not entirely borne out in the data, but
that period felt like a slog in terms of progress.</p>
<p><img src="progress.png" alt="Graph of weight lifted over time."></p>
<p>There is about two weeks of data missing between that graph and <a href="/weight-training-2#progression">the
last</a>.</p>
<p>What else can be seen there? The 160kg squat is my new elusive nemesis. My max
is once 2x157.5kg currently. Deadlift stalled at 160kg for a bit, but then took
off. I finally broke 100kg on the bench press.</p>
<h1 id="revamped-program">Revamped Program</h1>
<p>I finally changed my program! Or more properly, extended it. Previously, I&#39;d
been running classical <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/">Stronglifts</a> which had two workouts: squat, bench press
and barbell row for workout A; squat again, overhead press and deadlift for
workout B. What I did was drop the barbell row altogether (I described my
frustration with it <a href="/weight-training-2">last time</a> and it did return), and drop the squat from
workout B.</p>
<p>To supplement this, I integrated exercises from Jeremy Ethier&#39;s <a href="https://builtwithscience.com/best-full-body-workout/">full body
workout</a>, excepted the &quot;High to Low Cable Flies&quot; — couldn&#39;t fit it in
the schedule and this requires two cables systems, which tend to be fairly busy
machines.</p>
<p>I effected this change at around the start of March, as you can see from the row
disappearing from the graph above. There is also a correlation with the deadlift
finally taking off.</p>
<p>To track the new workout, I&#39;m using (in addition to the Stronglifts app) an app
called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.selahsoft.workoutlog">Simple Workout Log</a>. I&#39;m afraid it doesn&#39;t generate a graph for all
exercises, and generating one per exercise would be unwieldy however.</p>
<p>The workout is more body-building oriented than my previous strictly
power-lifting routine. Except for the barbell row, all the Stronglifts lifts
(the &quot;big lifts&quot;) also appear in the new workout. For them I kept the
Stronglifts progression and the focus on lifting heavy. For the other exercises
however I used Jeremy&#39;s guideline.</p>
<p>The result was increased volume. I finally look somewhat obviously muscular.
Although a lot of that had to do with nutrition.</p>
<h1 id="nutrition--measurements">Nutrition &amp; Measurements</h1>
<p>In January, I started actively tracking both my calorie expenditure (with a
<a href="https://www.fitbit.com/be/charge2">Fitbit Charge 2</a> that was actually loaned to me by my colleague Sana for
data-mining purposes) and my calorie expenses (using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myfitnesspal.android">MyFitnessPal</a> app,
just like about everybody).</p>
<p>The goal was to eat more to enable gains. My objective was to try to reach 3200
calories every day, and 3600 up to 4000 on workout days.</p>
<p>That (later and the workout change outlined above) worked nicely in enabling
some further mass gains.</p>
<p>I also bought a smart scale, but I&#39;m not that happy with it. It&#39;s accurate on
weight, but the bodyfat percentage given is wildly off: it has me at 13% which
would have me quite ripped — a more accurate scale gives 17%, which is in line
with picture references. Still, it can tell you if you&#39;re trending up or down
and some indication of the magnitude. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07GWCC412/">what I bought</a> so you can avoid
it. The more accurate scale is a big one at the gym. Apparently you have to look
for &quot;dual frequencies&quot; scales, but I couldn&#39;t find any.</p>
<p>I did get a lot of mileage out of a <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07BMNDW7F">kitchen scale</a> however, in order to get
more correct inputs into MyFitnessPal.</p>
<h1 id="next-up-cutting">Next Up: Cutting</h1>
<p>The next step is already underway: I&#39;m going to &quot;cut&quot; to reduce bodyfat and
obtain the sacro-sanct six pack.</p>
<p>I probably could have gained some more, but now feels like a nice time to try to
achieve this milestone, while I&#39;m finishing my PhD and still have flexibility in
my schedule. It&#39;s always harder to do something on the first go, as there are
things to figure out, and mistakes will necessarily be made.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been easing into it for three weeks, and early signs are encouraging.
However, a full discussion will have to wait for later!</p>
