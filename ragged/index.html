      <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2021</span>
<p>The past few months have been some of the hardest in my life.</p>
<p>That is not saying too much â€” I&#39;ve had, by and large, a very happy life. But as
far as I ever came close to something maybe remotely resembling burn out, that
time is now.</p>
<p>This was due to a combination of factors. Mostly it was the added workload of
<a href="/compilers">teaching a class</a> on top of main job (and doing it in my own effort-intensive
way), and picking up a hobby of very (and not entirely intentionally) <a href="/heat">stressful
trading</a>.</p>
<p>Still, for all the unpleasantness, I think there is a silver lining too.</p>
<p>For one, it feels like my work capacity has permanently increased. I feel much
more confident in my ability to stay on track and consistently work towards a
long-term project. In particular, I think I might now be able to move faster by
being able to spend more time on a project per time unit (day/week/...) than I
did previously.</p>
<p>I also learned a lot. About finance, teaching, and compilers even. I got to
improve <a href="https://github.com/norswap/autumn">existing software projects</a> and even create new ones (<a href="https://github.com/norswap/uranium">one</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/norswap/sigh">two</a>).</p>
<p>These benefits did come at the cost of running too close to the red line, for
too long. I think a <a href="/training">lifting</a> metaphor is in order. If you want to get stronger
or bigger, you need to train hard. But if you push yourself <em>too</em> hard or for
too long, you indulge in <em>overtraining</em>, which is detrimental to your goals.</p>
<p>So another lessons from all this is that I might push myself hard in the future,
but I&#39;ll avoid to making it quite this intense. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack">Only with slack can one be a
righteous dude.</a></p>
<p>Finally, the situation had me do a lot of hard thinking about where I was at,
and where I wanted to go. &quot;Never waste a good crisis&quot;, as they say.</p>
<p>See, when you&#39;re &quot;working&quot; all the time and most of the respite goes out the
window, you&#39;re really forced to consider whether you actually like what you&#39;re
doing.</p>
<p>Well, some of what I did (in which I include my job, teaching, and trading) I
liked, and some I liked less. I&#39;m planning to make changes. But first, maybe
I&#39;ll take a breather.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: I hesitated to write this post. The reason is that, while I write for myself
first, I like to write things that are useful for other people, even if the
style is a bit rough. This is mostly about my state of mind, there are not too
many details (on purpose), and I&#39;m not entirely sure the lessons transpose that
easily to other people in other situations.</p>
<p>However, this blog acts as a public record of what&#39;s going on with me, and this
felt momentous enough that it deserved a mention.</p>
<p>Second, I&#39;ve read similar things form other people in the past. Not only do I
remember them, but they have helped shape how I think about such things (in
particular, Sebastian Marshall&#39;s <a href="/celerity/#06-pace-maximum-vs-maximum-sustainable-speed">writings on Celerity</a> and <a href="https://podbay.fm/p/the-ultraworking-podcast/e/1571375400">his
personal account on pushing himself too far</a>). So maybe it&#39;s not that
useless.</p>
