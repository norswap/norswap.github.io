      <h1 class="post-title">Design of the $DJED Stablecoin</h1>
      <span class="post-date">16 May 2022</span>
<p>This was originally a <a href="https://twitter.com/norswap/status/1526004123811794944">tweet thread</a> that I have reproduced here for
discoverability and archive purposes (the copy was done on 24 October 2022).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve only slightly reformatted the text (mostly links), otherwise this is the
original version.</p>
<hr>
<p>1/16/ Earlier this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/liamihorne">@liamihorne</a> asked if anybody knew about the
design of the $DJED &quot;algorithmic&quot; stablecoin from @COTInetwork</p>
<p>I was curious, so I gave it a look...</p>
<p>2/ The stablecoin is not so much algorithmic as it is overcollateralized in a
way that separates minting from collateralization.</p>
<p>3/ On the minting side, users can mint $DJED (stable) for collateral at 100%
capital efficiency, if the supply is at least 400% collateralized (otherwise,
you can&#39;t mint). In this case, the collateral is $ADA, so if $ADA is worth 100$,
you get 100 $DJED back per $ADA.</p>
<p>4/ On the collateralization side, users can mint $SHEN for $ADA. As I
understand, $SHEN represents ownership of the $ADA held by the protocol on top
of 100% $DJED collateralization, and can be redeemed for that underlying.</p>
<p>5/ To preserve stability, $SHEN cannot be redeemed when the collateralization
ration (CR) falls under 400%. It also cannot be minted when CR is over 800% (to
avoid dilution of existing holders).</p>
<p>6/ This design is perfectly safe (as far as my basic understanding goes): the
stablecoin is overcollateralized, and if you fall below 400% CR, $SHEN holder
can&#39;t remove collateral.</p>
<p>7/ At that point it would take a 75% $ADA price drop for $DJED to be
uncollateralized. I must also assume the $ADA can be liquidated if approaching
100% CR (potentially pretty bad for $ADA price if the protocol is successful).</p>
<p>8/ Additionally, every action from this point onward can only improve the CR:</p>
<ul>
<li>If users redeem $DJED for $ADA, CR goes up.</li>
<li>If users mint $SHEN, CR goes up.</li>
</ul>
<p>So quite the opposite of a death spiral.</p>
<p>9/ For users, this is just a fairly unremakable overcollateralized stablecoin.
One exception: if you&#39;re a whale, you can get a lot of stables for your $ADA
without incurring slippage.</p>
<p>10/ There is also an argument that this avoids liquidaton cascades. I&#39;m not
entirely convinced, since you still have the problem in extreme cases (which is
when cascades occur) when you approach 100% CR.</p>
<p>11/ For $SHEN minters — if I&#39;m understanding is correct — you&#39;re essentially
levered long $ADA. If $ADA goes up, you own your share of the &gt; 100% pot when
you joined + what passes into this pot due to price increase.</p>
<p>12/ e.g. if people bought $DJED for $ADA at 100$, and $ADA goes up to $200, then
only half the original $ADA is necessary to collateralize the $DJED at 100%, the
other half passes to the part of the collateral that can be redeemed by $SHEN
holders.</p>
<p>13/ On the flip side, if $ADA drops, you&#39;re bearing not only the losses of the &gt;
100% pot, but also the losses of the $ADA that uses to 100% collateralize the
$DJED.</p>
<p>14/ $SHEN minters also have a claim to (some of?) the fees generated by the
protocol.</p>
<p>15/ Something interesting is that due to the fact that $SHEN cannot be redeemed
&lt; 400% CR, you probably can buy it at a discount on an AMM at that time (the
discount accouting for the lack of liquidity). This is actually a good thing
that promotes recollateralization.</p>
