<p>And now, for something completely different.</p>
<p>I have an ongoing project of going through my considerable music library to
isolate, rank and categorize its best tracks.</p>
<p>When the band Muse came under the microscope, I was very tempted to make a
compilation of my favourite tracks; and so I did just that.</p>
<p>Muse occupies a special place in my musical pantheon. I realized a few years ago
that I liked pretty much everything that they put out, which for me happens very
rarely. I&#39;m more inclined to listen to a hodge podge of individual tracks rather
than to complete albums.</p>
<p>I wanted this compilation to feel like a real album. Therefore it had to have
some kind of thematical consistency, some sense of continuity, and a pleasant
pacing. Oh, and it had to fit on a 80 minutes CD! I&#39;m pleased with the result,
and I hope you can enjoy it too.</p>
<p>Without further ado, the album:</p>

<p>Now for some trivia about the making of the pie...</p>
<h3 id="title">Title</h3>
<p>I gave the album the title <em>Black Holes &amp; Butterflies</em>, a mash up of the
track title <em>Butterflies &amp; Hurricanes</em> and the album title <em>Black Holes &amp;
Revelations</em> (a line from the song <em>Starlight</em>). The title can be interpreted in
many different ways, but doesn&#39;t really have any fixed meaning.</p>
<p>At some point, I hesitated to call the album <em>Uprising</em>, as the story told by
the songs can be interpreted as a journey of dissension. However, Muse already
has track called <em>Uprising</em>, which doesn&#39;t feature on this album. And in the
end, the poetry of <em>Black Holes &amp; Butterflies</em> quite rightfully won out.</p>
<h3 id="track-origin">Track Origin</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the tracks&#39; original albums:</p>
<pre><code>Black Holes &amp; Revelations   x4 (02, 08, 09, 11)
Absolution                  x4 (06, 10, 12, 13)
Origin of Symmetry          x3 (01, 07, 14)
The Resistance              x2 (03, 04)
The 2nd Law                 x1 (05)
</code></pre><p>If I had to make a ranking of my favourite Muse albums:</p>
<ol>
<li>Black Holes and Revelations (2006)</li>
<li>Absolution (2003)</li>
<li>Origin of Symmetry (2001)</li>
<li>The Resistance (2009)</li>
<li>Showbiz (1999)</li>
<li>The 2nd Law (2012)</li>
<li>Drones (2015)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is more or less consistent with the songs&#39; origin, with <em>Drones</em> not
featuring at all. Muse&#39;s debut album <em>Showbiz</em> doesn&#39;t feature either.
Thematically and musically, I feel it is rather distinct to the other albums:
it&#39;s a bit as if it happened before Muse found it&#39;s own grandiose
conspiracy-fueled self.</p>
<h3 id="discarded-tracks">Discarded Tracks</h3>
<p>Now for some tracks I really like but that didn&#39;t make the cut:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bliss (Origin of Symmetry)</li>
<li>Sing for Absolution (Absolution)</li>
<li>Apocalypse Please (Absolution)</li>
<li>Stockholm Syndrome (Absolution)</li>
<li>Ruled By Secrecy (Absolution)</li>
<li>United States of Eurasia (The Resistance)</li>
<li>Follow Me (The 2nd Law)</li>
<li>Panic Station (The 2nd Law)</li>
<li>Dead Inside (Drones)</li>
<li>Mercy (Drones)</li>
</ul>
<p>For most of them, the reason is pretty simple: they didn&#39;t fit musically,
thematically, or both.</p>
<p><em>Sing for Absolution</em> is probably the track I would have liked to include most.
While it&#39;s super powerful, the album isn&#39;t really about regrets, but more about
strife. It always looks forward, not backward.</p>
<p><em>Apocalypse Please</em> could have been included, but it&#39;s an ending track, and the
ending is already strong, between <em>Thoughts of a Dying Atheist</em> and <em>Time is
Running Out</em>. I was also keen to have <em>Feeling Good</em> as final track, to end on
an ethereal fresh note. Nevertheless, this would definitely have been included
if not for the time restriction.</p>
<p><em>Ruled by Secrecy</em> would have been a strong contender if I needed a lull
somewhere in the album (which would have made a lot of sense if it had been
longer). Finally, <em>Stockholm Syndrome</em> would have blended in just fine, but it
was just a weaker candidate all around.</p>
<h3 id="cover-art">Cover Art</h3>
<p>I actually made two versions of the cover art: the one you can see on the
youtube videos and just below, and the one towards the top of the article.</p>
<p>The one below I found by searching for pictures of black holes. I used it to
upload the videos. But then I found the second picture, which depicts the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6302">butterfly nebula</a>. I couldn&#39;t resist the fact that it linked both compoments of
the album title, and it looks pretty neat too.</p>
