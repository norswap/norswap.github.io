      <span class="post-date">11 Mar 2022</span>
<p>This was originally a <a href="https://twitter.com/norswap/status/1502085000967061504">tweet thread</a> that I have reproduced here for
discoverability and archive purposes (the copy was done on 23 October 2022).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve only slightly reformatted the text (mostly links), otherwise this is the
original version.</p>
<hr>
<p>With the Cannon bug bounty out, it&#39;s time for me to take my best stab at
describing what it is, and how it works.</p>
<p>Cannon is our next-gen EVM-equivalent fault proof system. It&#39;s what will keep
your funds secure when you use Optimism. Read to know more!</p>
<p><img src="/cannon-intro/op-cannon.png" alt=""></p>
<p>1/44 What to expect?</p>
<ul>
<li>Recap on optimistic rollups / fault proofs</li>
<li>Short history of fault proofs at Optimism</li>
<li>Most thorough explanation of Cannon (fault proofs?) to ever grace Twitter — quite technical, but approachable</li>
<li>My longest twitter thread to date</li>
</ul>
<p>LET&#39;S FUCKING GO</p>
<p>2/ Optimistic rollups in brief: users send txs to sequencer. Sequencer executes
transactions and creates L2 blocks. It also (a) &quot;rolls up&quot; transaction into
batches submitted to L1 (as calldata) and (b) submits output hashes (which we&#39;ll
equate to L2 block hashes here) to L1.</p>
<p>3/ Validators follow the L1 chain, get txs from batches, re-execute them, and
compare the resulting block hashes to the ones submitted by the sequencer.</p>
<p>If there&#39;s a mismatch, they challenge the incorrect block hash via a <em>fault
proof</em>. This is where Cannon comes in.</p>
<p>4/ (I&#39;m simplifying on purpose here, you can also send L1-to-L2 and L2-to-L1
txs, such as deposits and withdrawals. But this is isn&#39;t crucial to this
explanation.)</p>
<p>5/ A rollups&#39; fault proof system is a way to prove on the L1 chain (i.e.
<em>trustlessly</em>) that processing the txs from an L2 block doesn&#39;t yield the block
whose hash was submitted by the sequencer.</p>
<p>6/ (Crucially, the L2 block includes the state root: a hash of the L2 state
after executing the txs in the block. This will typically be apple of discord.)</p>
<p>7/ The easiest way to perform a fault proof is to re-execute the whole block on
L1. This is what Optimism&#39;s previous fault system attempted to do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this system had many issues.</p>
<p>8/ To keep costs manageable, every block carried a single transaction. This
would have had very bad consequences for the scalability of the rollup in the
long term. Not to mention, it&#39;s very different from how L1 does things.</p>
<p>9/ Second, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreting</a> EVM bytecode onchain is just too expensive.</p>
<p>This led to the original OVM: a system to deploy L2 bytecode as L1 bytecode.</p>
<p>10/ The original OVM design works well for simple things, but not when &quot;context&quot;
is needed. For instance, you can&#39;t translate the L2 NUMBER opcode (returning
block height) to the L1 NUMBER opcode! These opcodes needed to be translated
into calls to special contracts.</p>
<p>11/ Similar issues played out for things like L2 contract calls.</p>
<p>Replacing opcodes &amp; calls by larger EVM routines &amp; contract calls also meant
that the max size of contracts on L2 was smaller the max L1 contract size!</p>
<p>12/ (And indirectly this also caused the choice of requiring a patched Solidity
compiler. Though it must be said other designs were possible there.)</p>
<p>13/ The original OVM design was a good first attempt, but it was also clear it
wasn&#39;t a good long term solution.</p>
<p>14/ After the team (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/karl_dot_tech">@karl_dot_tech</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_chain">@ben_chain</a>) &amp;
<a href="https://twitter.com/realgeorgehotz">@realGeorgeHotz</a> came up with the idea for Cannon, it was decided to
drop the old fault proof system to start from a sane foundation. This was the
OVM 2.0 re-genesis.</p>
<p>15/ (I wasn&#39;t at Optimism at that time and wasn&#39;t consulted, but these names are
pretty terrible. The OVM 1.0 (just like Arbitrum&#39;s AVM) is only a VM in the most
abstract sense — it&#39;s a modified instruction set translated to run on the EVM.
The OVM 2.0 is not a VM in any sense.)</p>
<p>16/ So how does Cannon prove a [txs → block hash] mismatch if it does not
execute the whole block on chain?</p>
<p>The solution is in two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The challenge game</li>
<li>The single step execution</li>
</ol>
<p>17/ The challenge game is a binary search over the execution trace of the &quot;fault
proof program&quot;.</p>
<p>In our case that program is one that, in first approximation, takes the L2 chain
state and some transactions as inputs and emits an L2 block hash.</p>
<p>18/ George called this program &quot;minigeth&quot;.</p>
<p>In reality its input is a set of L1 blockhashes, and the input will be a set of
L2 blockhashes. I&#39;ll skip the details here as they get into the weeds of
Optimism Bedrock and not super relevant.</p>
<p>19/ The important thing is that the input L1 blockhashes are a <em>commitment</em> to
all the inputs we actually care about: the L2 state and the transactions. We can
prove these things against the blockhash. For instance, we can prove that a
batch was posted to one of these L1 blocks.</p>
<p>20/ To retrieve the transactions &amp; L2 state, minigeth uses a component called
&quot;the preimage oracle&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a generic component that lets you go from a hash to a preimage. This is normally
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack">impossible</a> to compute for cryptographic hashes.</p>
<p>21/ So the trick will be to get these [hash → preimage] mappings from somewhere.
I&#39;ll explain later how the preimage oracle is implemented on &amp; off-chain. But
take it for granted for now.</p>
<p>22/ So we have minigeth with our preimage oracle (which btw entirely replaces
geth&#39;s usual database).</p>
<p>We compile this to some instruction set, and execute it for our L1 blocks. This
yields an execution trace, which is the list of every instruction executed
during the execution.</p>
<p>23/ During the challenge game, both the challenger and the sequencer do this,
and then perform a binary search to find the first instruction whose result they
disagree on.</p>
<p>24/ It&#39;s a binary search because they start by looking a the result of the
instruction 1/2 of the way through. If they disagree, they&#39;ll look at the
instruction 1/4 of the way through, otherwise the instruction 3/4 of the way
through, etc...</p>
<p>25/ They&#39;ll keep narrowing the range until they zero in on a single instruction
they disagree on.</p>
<p>(Note that the challenger and the sequencer don&#39;t actually need to agree on the
size of the execution trace.)</p>
<p>26/ What&#39;s the &quot;result of an instruction&quot;? What do they agree/disagree on? It&#39;s
simply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle root</a> of a snapshot of the minigeth&#39;s memory!</p>
<p>27/ George decided to compile minigeth to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture">MIPS</a>. So every step in the
execution trace is a MIPS instruction.</p>
<p>Why MIPS? It was one of the simplest instruction for which to implement an
interpreter on-chain, and Go can natively compile to MIPS!</p>
<p>28/ To do all of the above, we need to be able to run minigeth off-chain, to (1)
get the execution trace and (2) generate MIPS memory snapshots.</p>
<p>This is done by running the MIPS minigeth binary on the QEMU CPU emulator, and
hooking into the emulator.</p>
<p>29/ Off-chain (in MIPS-on-QEMU), the preimage oracle is implemented via calls to
a JSON-RPC endpoint (i.e. querying an Ethereum node). In minigeth, each oracle
use is tagged with its type, so we know which JSON-RPC call to emit.</p>
<p>30/ (The most common JSON-RPC call is &quot;eth_getProof&quot;, used very creatively to
retrieve storage slots and trie nodes.)</p>
<p>31/ Alright, so the challenger and sequencer have agreed to disagree on a single
instruction.</p>
<p>Next comes the single step execution.</p>
<p>The goal is to execute that single instruction, on the L1 chain.</p>
<p>32/ For this, we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>An on-chain MIPS interpreter to interpret any instruction</li>
<li>Any location in MIPS memory that the instruction might read</li>
<li>Any preimage that the instruction might request</li>
</ol>
<p>33/ (1) was simply written by George.</p>
<p>For (2), we already have a Merkle root of a memory snapshot taken right before
the instruction (from the challenge game). We can use it to prove any memory
location we might need to supply.</p>
<p>34/ For (3), we simply presupply the [hash → preimage] mapping by supplying
the preimage, and then the hash is derived on-chain.</p>
<p>Note that minigeth off-chain is also instructed to save all the [hash →
preimage] mappings it uses, so we have those handy.</p>
<p>35/ Obviously, &quot;preimage requests&quot; are not a native MIPS instruction. Instead,
it&#39;s encoded as a read to a pre-defined memory location, which &quot;magically&quot; has
the preimage of the hash that was previously written at another pre-defined
memory location.</p>
<p>36/ This behaviour is implemented in the MIPS interpreter on-chain, and in the
QEMU hooks off-chain.</p>
<p>37/ Alright, so finally we can use our pre-supplied memory and preimages to run
the single MIPS instruction on the on-chain MIPS interpreter. This yields a new
memory snapshot Merkle root, which can be compared to the root asserted by the
challenger.</p>
<p>38/ If its Merkle root is the same, the challenge is valid, and the challenger
wins.</p>
<p>We haven&#39;t talked about this here, but in this case the challenger would receive
the sequencer&#39;s &quot;bond&quot; as a reward.</p>
<p>39/ And that&#39;s most of what there is to it!</p>
<p>‼️ A very important note before I give you some further reading.</p>
<p>The current implementation of Cannon DOES NOT allow you to challenge L2 blocks.
Instead, it&#39;s a proof-of-concept that allows you to challenge L1 blocks.</p>
<p>40/ So minigeth is currently a program that takes a blockhash as input and
verifies the validity of that block by re-executing it on top of the previous
state.</p>
<p>Obviously, no L1 block should ever be invalid, meaning no challenge should ever
succeed.</p>
<p>41/ At least that&#39;s the theory we&#39;re putting on the line in our <a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimismcannon/">bug bounty
program</a>. Break this assumption and make 50k$ !</p>
<p>42/ That was a looong thead, but I still had to simplify quite a bit and ommit
some details.</p>
<p>So, were can you learn more about Cannon? I&#39;m glad you ask!</p>
