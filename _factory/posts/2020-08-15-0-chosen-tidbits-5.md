[If You’re Busy, You’re Doing Something Wrong: The Surprisingly Relaxed Lives of Elite Achievers](

> The time diaries revealed that both groups (elite and average players) spent, on
> average, the same number of hours on music per week (around 50).

> The elite players were spending almost three times more hours than the average
> players on deliberate practice — the uncomfortable, methodical work of
> stretching your ability.

> The average players, they discovered, spread their work throughout the day. The
> elite players, by contrast, consolidated their work into two well-defined
> periods (two peaks: in the morning and in the afternoon).

> The elite players slept an hour more per night than the average players. The
> elite players were significantly more relaxed than the average players.

Hard work (delibrate practice) vs hard to do work (draining, busy).

> The solution suggested by this research, as well as my own, is as simple as it
> is startling: Do less. But do what you do with complete and hard focus. Then
> when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of the day.

> Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability and
> determination. But there's a third ingredient that's not as well understood:
> an obsessive interest in a particular topic.

> When you look at the lives of people who've done great work, you see a
> consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket collector's obsessive
> interest in something that would have seemed pointless to most of their
> contemporaries. One of the most striking features of Darwin's book about his
> voyage on the Beagle is the sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His
> curiosity seems infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out
> on his slate what happens to series.
>
> But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket collector. Series
> matter, and bus tickets don't.
>
> It's a mistake to think they were "laying the groundwork" for the discoveries
> they made later. There's too much intention in that metaphor. Like bus ticket
> collectors, they were doing it because they liked it.
>
> If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might be it: to
> have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.
>
> Aren't I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you might
> think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for ability and a
> substitute for determination. Unless you have sufficient mathematical
> aptitude, you won't find series interesting. And when you're obsessively
> interested in something, you don't need as much determination: you don't need
> to push yourself as hard when curiosity is pulling you.

> But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an obsession might
> be one that matters. For example, it's more promising if you're creating
> something, rather than just consuming something someone else creates. It's
> more promising if something you're interested in is difficult, especially if
> it's more difficult for other people than it is for you.

> But you can never be sure. In fact, here's an interesting idea that's also
> rather alarming if it's true: it may be that to do great work, you also have
> to waste a lot of time.

[Consistency is The Key](http://tynan.com/thekey)

> The most productive people I know are people who absolutely master the basics.
> They know how to fill the time in the day with the most important tasks they
> have, and they know how to string those days together in such a way that
> they're making meaningful progress.
>
> The most important basic skill to master, without a doubt, is consistency.
> Those who are able to be consistent end up with huge success, very often much
> greater success than they expected or even hoped for.
>
> People in finance say that people aren't able to comprehend the benefits of
> compounding interest over time. Consistency in productivity creates compound
> benefits which people are similarly not able to comprehend. Your starting
> point doesn't matter, because you can quickly scale up to your capacity once
> you have a history and habit of consistency.
>
> Let's say you wanted to write a book. Maybe you'd tried and failed before. If
> you commit to writing for thirty minutes every day for a month, you'll write
> at least 10 to 15 thousand words. Not bad. Then the next month you up your
> quota to just one hour. Now you have a cumulative 30 to 45 thousand words. Not
> quite a book yet, but you're a month away.
>
> And how easy does that process sound? Anyone can do half an hour a day. Anyone
> who has done a half hour a day for a month can do an hour a day. And anyone
> who has done an hour a day can do another month.

> Interestingly, it doesn't seem to matter what you choose to be consistent on
> or how easy or difficult it is. I've experimented a lot with this, and even
> the easiest tasks lead to a positive spiral of consistency. I've found that as
> soon as I get a coaching client to be consistent with any tasks relevant to
> their lives, they will generally remain consistent forever, with a few
> variances here and there

[The Standford Marshmallow Experiment](

> I’m not convinced that the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment tests for anything
> even remotely resembling “innate willpower,” because waiting fifteen minutes
> for a single marshmallow is a stupid thing to do.

> The experiment could have lacked any tangible reward and some kids
> still would have waited.

> There’s a type of joke that I think of as the “white people” joke, although
> it’s rarely funny and it doesn’t have to be about someone who’s white. The
> joke is about a mid-40’s housewife who is way too well-educated and bored to
> be a housewife, and so she tries to find the Grail of healthy food (organic,
> GMO-free, low acidity, one diet after another) and she plants a garden, and
> she adopts pets, and she joins nonprofits, and she joins the school board, and
> she reads every novel on NPR’s end of the year list, and she gets weekly
> therapy and monthly massages (to about the same effect), and she meditates on
> the present, and she achieves peace with the past, and she contemplates the
> future, and everything is feng shui, and yet, despite all this, she feels
> restless, anxious, unhappy, and she dreams of some sort of vacation.
>
> Or sometimes the joke is about an elderly businessman on his second hair
> transplant and third cardiac stent and twenty-billionth dollar, and his kids
> all have grandkids and his wife is deceased, and when he goes out he he orders
> scotch more expensive than houses, but that isn’t too often—he’s seen enough
> parties, he’s seen enough people, he has no strong affections, and he works
> round the clock fighting tooth-and-nail for his billions, because he’s not
> sure what else, exactly, he’s supposed to be doing.
>
> Or the joke is about a magazine-cover movie actress who has the adoration of
> thousands and still feels worthless. Or the joke is about a virginal computer
> science genius who has deleted his OKCupid and decided to eschew all noncoding
> activities. Or the joke is about a millionaire athlete under investigation for
> using anabolic steroids. Or the joke is about a 50-something cardiologist who
> hates all his patients but knows that he’d hate being retired even more. Or
> the joke is about a young power couple who like each other very much, love,
> maybe, but they’re both distracted by the nagging feeling that they could do
> better, that they should be shooting for something greater, and so they break
> up and find new partners and the process repeats again.
>
> And the joke, which you hear on forums or sitcoms or in crowded sports bars,
> goes: “Haha, even though these people are successful, they’re still

>
> And I’m here to tell you that this joke is totally backwards. It’s because
> these people have always been dissatisfied that they achieved success.

> This study implies that socially prescribed perfectionism is maladaptive and
> self oriented perfectionism is adaptive, but it has the causality backwards. If

> 85. The financial/investment world has no clue what's going on, is afraid of

> The One Weird Trick is increasingly being executed by minds that have already
> retreated to New Zealand bunkers

> 90. Most bad politics arises out of bad literary tastes, as in enjoying stories
> about stereotypes. Good politics arises out of pattern matching archetypes while
> they still have "alpha" (predictive power) with a tasteful literary sensibility

> 91. Stereotypes are real, and there is always a subset of every stereotyped
> population that actually willingly conforms to that stereotype, performing it
> with an aggressive deadness. These dead player zombies are the core of all
> politics. All politics is about seeing dead people.

> 93. Zizek is correct. The Normie ideology is cynicism, and conversely, all
> ideology turns into cynicism by the time it goes normie. This is why Noble Lie
> political philosophy is bs because there is no unawakened consciousness laboring

> 97. You have no obligation to be useful or interesting to the world.
