<p>This time, I&#39;m also reviewing books!</p>
<h2 id="darwins-game">Darwin&#39;s Game</h2>
<p>I forgot to review this one <a href="/reviews-6">last time</a>.</p>
<p>In short, it follows the &quot;death game&quot; formula: the protagonist gets sucked in a
game (via a smartphone app in this case) that gives him powers and in which
currency can be acquired by defeating (lethaly or not) other players. Of course
there&#39;s a bunch of psychopaths, but also potential allies.</p>
<p>Really enjoyed it, it was pretty fun. The show is thoughtful about powers and
how to use them. Nothing incredibly, but it&#39;s only an 11-episode show and it&#39;s
well worth a watch.</p>
<h2 id="erased-boku-dake-ga-inai-machi">Erased (Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi)</h2>
<p>I really liked this one. The basic plot is that the hero is sent back to his
elementary school past, where he endeavours to prevent the murder of three kids
in his home town. These events are also connected to his present.</p>
<p>The story is really solid and there is some real mystery. The tone reminded of
<a href="/reviews-4/#parasyte">Parasyte</a> a lot: it feels &quot;mature&quot; - it&#39;s darker than most anime, but never
edgy.</p>
<p>Like Parasyte, this had the advantage to be an adaption of a finished series,
and a short one at that — the anime is only 12 episodes long.</p>
<p>Really solid recommendation from me, there is no reason not to watch this.</p>
<h2 id="unsong">Unsong</h2>
<p>And now, a book review! Unsong is a book you can <a href="http://unsongbook.com/">read for free online</a>,
written by the brilliant Scott Alexander (of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Slate Star Codex</a>&#39;s fame — one of
my favorite blogs).</p>
<p>As for the (wild!) plot: in 1972, instead of sending men on the moon, the Apollo
rocket crashed into the vast crystal sphere encircling the world. It turns out
it was part of the vast machinery of heaven built by archangel Uriel to slow the
divine light to a trickle, and ensure science works properly. With it cracked,
divine light enters the world once more and as some technology stop working, the
supernatural becomes possible once more. In particular, it is possible to speak
some of the names of god in order to produce spell-like effects.</p>
<p>Unsong is imaginative and brilliant. There are many other things introduced in
the universe besides the names of god, and their consequences are taken
seriously (though always somewhat humorously as well). For instance, there is a
whole branch of government (the titular <em>Unsong</em>) dedicated to enforcing
copyrights on the names of god.</p>
<p>Unsong is brilliant, but it is also weird. Its lore centers around the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>, and it&#39;s full of kabalistic jokes. Things like &quot;this word means X
and Y and Z and so we get meanings A, B and C&quot;. It&#39;s clever and cute, but it
works better the first three times than the 50th time. Towards the end, I got a
bit tired of it, especially since it breaks the rythm of the descent towards the
conclusion.</p>
<p>Unsong is really two intertwined stories of different magnitudes. On the one
hand it is the story happening in the story&#39;s present in the 2010s, and on the
other hand it is the story of how the world evolved since 1972, under the
influence of the radical new conditions.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really hard to describe Unsong as a story I realize. I think the best thing
would be to give it a shot. If you generally like fiction that is a little weird
(e.g. Terry Pratchett, Snow Crash, ...) then I&#39;d definitely recommend it. Ditto
if you tend to enjoy Scott&#39;s normal writing.</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-and-fall-of-software-recipes">The Rise and Fall of Software Recipes</h2>
<p><img src="banana-book.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Aka <em>the banana book</em>, after the lovely fruit peel that adorns the cover.
It&#39;s written by <a href="https://www.dariusblasband.com/">Darius Blasband</a>, the founder of <a href="https://www.raincode.com/">Raincode</a>.</p>
<p>Now, from reading the book&#39;s back cover, you&#39;d be forgiven to think the book had
some grand thesis about &quot;software recipes&quot; and methodologies.</p>
<p>In reality, the book never really bothers to define what a software recipe is
(it does convey that it is a cookie cutter pattern to make software). Instead,
it should be taken as Darius&#39;s working, tech &amp; business, memoir.</p>
<p>In that sense, I think the book works relatively well. Darius describes himself
as a &quot;codeaholic&quot;, and he is definitely a compiler geek — which also happens to
be my case. As such many chapters of the book where of particular interest to
me. That being said, they remain accessible enough that any semi-competent
programmer should be able to understand the subject matter.</p>
<p>I sometimes disagreed with Darius, and often wanted to add more nuance, but his
opinions never struck me as wrong-headed. There&#39;s a lot of references to
projects and experiences on the ground that help to lend weight to some of his
points.</p>
<p>The writing is snappy and fun enough to keep you engaged. Chapters are typically
not too long, and the books lends itself well to sporadic reading. It would
actually have made a great toilet book. That being said, don&#39;t expect your mind
to be blown away either. This is a no-nonsense collection software advice,
stories and ideas. While there are definitely some nuggets of insight to glean
there, I don&#39;t think this will cause anyone that wasn&#39;t already on board to
reconsider their whole processes.</p>
<h2 id="kaguya-sama-love-is-war">Kaguya-sama: Love is War</h2>
<p>This was strongly recommended to me by my friend Gorby. And I have to admit:
it&#39;s damn funny. The humor reminded me of <a href="/reviews-4/#dumbbell-nan-kilo-moteru-how-heavy-are-the-dumbells-you-lift">Dumbbell nan Kilo</a>, in a good way.
Despite the silly tone, the last episode managed to have my heart in a vise.
That&#39;s how you know it&#39;s good.</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;m a sucket for that opening theme:</p>

allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>That Japanese crooner really did steal my heart 😍 I also like the visuals, it
reminisced me of the better James Bond openings.</p>
<h2 id="3-gatsu-no-lion-march-comes-in-like-a-lion">3-gatsu no Lion (March Comes In Like a Lion)</h2>
<p>3-gatsu no Lion has an excellent MyAnimeList score (8.45) and has is often
described as being great &amp; artful. And I was curious to know what the fuss was
about. Well, I ended up dropping it (for the nonce at least) after 10 episodes
(out of 22 for the first season).</p>
<p>It&#39;s not bad by any stretch of the imagination. It&#39;s just... very contemplative?
Slow? I think what I&#39;ve seen so far could have been conveyed in half the time,
there are very repetitive scenes. At the same time, it might have been
deliberate. The anime certainly feels deliberate, and not like it&#39;s trying to
please anyone, nor give itself a genre.</p>
<p>Of course, this is related to the subject matter, which is ... complex. It&#39;s
about the state of mind of this young pro shogi player. I&#39;ll paste the MAL
description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having reached professional status in middle school, Rei Kiriyama is one of
the few elite in the world of shogi. Due to this, he faces an enormous amount
of pressure, both from the shogi community and his adoptive family. Seeking
independence from his tense home life, he moves into an apartment in Tokyo. As
a 17-year-old living on his own, Rei tends to take poor care of himself, and
his reclusive personality ostracizes him from his peers in school and at the
shogi hall.</p>
<p>However, not long after his arrival in Tokyo, Rei meets Akari, Hinata, and
Momo Kawamoto, a trio of sisters living with their grandfather who owns a
traditional wagashi shop. Akari, the oldest of the three girls, is determined
to combat Rei&#39;s loneliness and poorly sustained lifestyle with motherly
hospitality. The Kawamoto sisters, coping with past tragedies, also share with
Rei a unique familial bond that he has lacked for most of his life. As he
struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally through his shogi
career, Rei must learn how to interact with others and understand his own
complex emotions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, I dropped it because I found myself dragging my feet a little to
watch it, which is not a good sign. I <em>might</em> give another chance at some point,
as I think there might be something great which I haven&#39;t gotten to.</p>
<h2 id="mob-psycho-100-season-1">Mob Psycho 100 (Season 1)</h2>
<p><img src="mob-psycho-100.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I almost dropped Mob Psycho 100 after the first episode, which repeated its
&quot;funny&quot; shtick a bit too much, and I was unsure about the graphical style. I&#39;m
glad I didn&#39;t, as it turns out it&#39;s quite entertaining, and you get used to the
goofiness.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t call it groundbreaking or anything, but it&#39;s short (12 episodes) and
watchable. I don&#39;t really have much more to say about it. It seems to be a very
beloved show (8.5 rating on MAL), and I can understand, the anime is not
incredible, but it is emminently sympathetic.</p>
<h2 id="hamefura">Hamefura</h2>
<p><img src="hamefura.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>(Whole title &quot;Otome Game no Hametsu Flag ...&quot; or &quot;My Next Life as a Villainess:
All Routes Lead to Doom!&quot;)</p>
<p>This anime was not at all what I expected it to be. The premise is that the
titular character gets reincarnated in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel">visual novel</a> romance game, as the
villainess character.</p>
<p>From this premise I expected a <a href="/reviews-4/#the-rising-of-the-shield-hero">Shield Hero</a>-like situation: the main character
being treated unfairly and having (in this case) to battle its way to
recognition.</p>
<p>Well, spoilers: that&#39;s not at all what happens. Instead this is a very wholesome
sorta-kinda-harem anime.</p>
<p>And I really really loved it. I don&#39;t really know why - the story is nothing to
write home about. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the <em>wholesomeness</em> of the whole affair that
just put me in a good mood. It reminded me a bit of what I liked about <a href="/more-anime/#k-on">K-On!</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gleipnir">Gleipnir</h2>
<p>Plot-wise, Gleipnir is a sort of death game where protagonists have special
abilities. In that, it&#39;s quite similar to last season&#39;s <a href="#darwin-s-game">Darwin&#39;s Game</a>, but the
similarity stops there.</p>
<p>Whereas Darwin&#39;s game is very focused on the strategies and combat, Gleipnir is
more about the mystery of the game&#39;s existence. Well, at least it tries to.</p>
<p>The start is intriguing enough, but then the anime tramples around in its
midsection, not achieving much. The mystery plotline picks up towards the end,
just enough to keep things interesting. It&#39;s not all that masterfully executed
however. They also could easily have concluded the 13 episode arc with some something
more impactful happening.</p>
<p>I was ready to give up around episode 8, then got interested enough to finish,
but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll care enough for season 2 (if they make it).</p>
<h2 id="yesterday-wo-uttate">Yesterday wo Uttate</h2>
<p>I started watching this show on the basis of its wistful mood. I&#39;d seen a short
review of it (part of an overview of the whole season) that praised its little
philosophical sentences — but as it turned out there were relatively few of
them.</p>
<p>The show is about a sort of amorous ... rectangle (?) between two guys and two
gals. I won&#39;t deny the setting and the mood is nice, but unfortunately the story
gets nowhere pretty fast. A lot of time is spent of repetitions rather than
evolution in the characters&#39; relationship. The conclusion comes out of the blue,
and does not really feel satisfying, or really coherent with what transpired
before.</p>
<p>Maybe it can just be seen as a realistic (or more realistic than usual) take on
human relationship — with a unmistakable Japanese flair.</p>
<p>This feels like it could have been so much better if the story had been better
conceived though.</p>
