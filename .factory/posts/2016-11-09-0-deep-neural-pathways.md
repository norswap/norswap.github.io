I sometimes worry that by specializing in certain of tasks at the exclusion of
others, I will lose the ability to learn new abilities; that my neural pathways
will get frozen in a certain configuration, baking my current skillset into my
brain.

But maybe it isn't that bad. You lose flexibility, but you gain efficiency.
People who are great at their job do have it "wired" in them in some sense. They
see what is relevant from so far, it's eerie. Maybe it's because they ONLY see
what is relevant to their area of expertise.

Of course, one should thrive to bake in the *right* sets of defaults. And to
know when to reconfigure.

Yesterday on Slack, a colleague (Simon) linked a video of
[a guy learning to ride an inverse bicycle][bicycle] that turns right when you
steer left and vice-versa. Turns out it's amazingly hard. But after eight
months, he got it. And guess what: after a while he couldn't ride the normal
bicycle anymore -- he had to try 20 minutes for it to come bad.

So what he did was not that he became more flexible: he overwrote a set of baked
circuitry with another set. I don't know what the moral is, but it certainly
makes you think.
