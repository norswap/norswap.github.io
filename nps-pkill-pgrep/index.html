<p>As I was prepping my new computer, and <a href="/unix-daemons/">toying with unix daemons</a>, I found
myself checking on running processes regularly, and occasionally killing them. I
also found myself being quite frustrated with the tools provided by the system
for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id="checking-processes">Checking Processes</h2>
<p>To check what a process is up to (or if it is running at all), you&#39;d run a
command like this (here, assuming I&#39;m interested in the status of the <code>sleep</code>
process):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ps aux | grep sleep
# norswap    58694   0.0  0.0  4399328    728 s006  S+    2:26PM   0:00.00 grep sleep
# norswap    58686   0.0  0.0  4268240    576 s003  S+    2:26PM   0:00.00 sleep 300</code></pre>
<p>This is an incantation I&#39;ve personally memorized a long time ago. I didn&#39;t even
remember what those <code>aux</code> flags meant.</p>
<p>(As it turns out, omitting the dash (<code>-</code>) toggles legacy mode, in which <code>u</code>
displays more info. <code>a</code> and <code>x</code> work like they do with a dash, respectively
displaying processes from all users and showing processes that are not attached
to a controlling terminal.)</p>
<p>This is less than ideal. For one, the output includes a line that matches the
<code>grep</code> command itself!</p>
<p>Here is the remedy, where <code>grep -v</code> excludes matching lines (and no, there is no
easy way to merge the two <code>grep</code> commands):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ps -ax | grep -v &quot; grep &quot; | grep foobar</code></pre>
<p>Frankly, not something you&#39;d want to type each time.</p>
<p>Another thing that bothers me is: what are all these numbers and letters? Do I
care?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start by omitting our legacy <code>u</code> option. Then, by default (at leasts on
stock macOS Catalina!), you&#39;ll get the following fields:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ps ax | head -1
#  PID   TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND</code></pre>
<p>You should know what the <code>PID</code> is (the process ID), <code>TT</code> is an identifier for
the controlling terminal (e.g. <code>s006</code>) or <code>??</code> if there are no controlling
terminal.</p>
<p>The <code>STAT</code> column lists flags that gives information on the status of the
process. Info about which can be found under the &quot;state&quot; heading when running
<code>man ps</code> on my mac:</p>
<pre><code class="language-none">state     The state is given by a sequence of characters, for example, ``RWNA&#39;&#39;.
          The first character indicates the run state of the process:

  I       Marks a process that is idle (sleeping for longer than about 20 seconds).
  R       Marks a runnable process.
  S       Marks a process that is sleeping for less than about 20 seconds.
  T       Marks a stopped process.
  U       Marks a process in uninterruptible wait.
  Z       Marks a dead process (a ``zombie&#39;&#39;).

  Additional characters after these, if any, indicate additional state information:

  +       The process is in the foreground process group of its control terminal.
  &lt;       The process has raised CPU scheduling priority.
  &gt;       The process has specified a soft limit on memory requirements and is currently
          exceeding that limit; such a process is (necessarily) not swapped.
  A       the process has asked for random page replacement (VA_ANOM, from vadvise(2), for
          example, lisp(1) in a garbage collect).
  E       The process is trying to exit.
  L       The process has pages locked in core (for example, for raw I/O).
  N       The process has reduced CPU scheduling priority (see setpriority(2)).
  S       The process has asked for FIFO page replacement (VA_SEQL, from vadvise(2), for
          example, a large image processing program using virtual memory to sequentially
          address voluminous data).
  s       The process is a session leader.
  V       The process is suspended during a vfork(2).
  W       The process is swapped out.
  X       The process is being traced or debugged.</code></pre>
<p>There is a different output (probably Linux) <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/360252/what-do-the-stat-column-values-in-ps-mean#360253">listed in this StackOverflow
answer</a> that you might find handy.</p>
<p>The <code>TIME</code> column: the CPU time the process has consumed since it started, in
<code>&lt;hours&gt;:&lt;minutes&gt;.&lt;second&gt;</code> format.</p>
<p>And finally the <code>COMMAND</code> itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-system-has-you-covered-maybe">The System Has You Covered... Maybe?</h2>
<p>So of course, the double <code>grep</code> thing is insane. I think some people might have
some point have recognized this. What did these good souls do? Come up with
<code>pgrep</code>, of course!</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pgrep sleep
# 58686</code></pre>
<p>The number printed out is the PID of matched processes. That <code>pgrep sleep</code>
command is approximately equivalent to the following full pipe:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ps -ax | grep -v &quot; grep &quot; | grep sleep | awk &#39;{ print $1 }&#39;
# 58686</code></pre>
<p>But not exactly. On the plus side, it&#39;s slightly more robust, for instance it
wouldn&#39;t ignore entries in the very unlikely scneario where entries of interest
contain the &quot; grep &quot; string. <code>pgrep</code> just ignores its own process and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>Also, by default <code>pgrep</code> only matches on the program name and not on the
arguments.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you&#39;ve now lost all ability to get any other information
about the process, which sucks.</p>
<p>Pointedly, it even sucks if all you want to do is find the PID of a process in
order to kill it! You might have caught the wrong process, but since its name is
not displayed, you&#39;ll never find out. And if your query matches more than one
process, you don&#39;t have any visual feedback on how to refine the search.</p>
<p>Ok, so <code>pgrep</code> does have a <code>-l</code> flag that will print out the name of the process
(and the arguments if <code>-f</code>, which makes it match on the arguments as well, is
given). But there are no flags to retrieve any other piece of information.</p>
<h2 id="killing-processes">Killing Processes</h2>
<p>Once you have the PID, it&#39;s quite easy. Just <code>kill -9 &lt;PID&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>One way to do it is to run a <code>grep</code> (or <code>pgrep</code>) command and copy the PID by
hand.</p>
<p>Another way is use some piping:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ps -ax | grep sleep # identify process
$ ps -ax | grep sleep | grep -v &quot; grep &quot; | awk &#39;{ print $1 }&#39; | xargs kill -9 # kill it</code></pre>
<p>Adding <code>awk &#39;{ print $1 }&#39;</code> outputs the first column (the PIDs), while <code>xargs</code>
transmits them to <code>kill -9</code> as arguments.</p>
<p>Or using <code>pgrep</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pgrep -l sleep # identify process
$ pkill !* # kill it</code></pre>
<p>Here the trick is <code>!*</code> which passes the same arguments as the previous command
 (<code>pgrep</code>) to <code>pkill</code>. <code>pkill</code> is <code>pgrep</code>&#39;s cousin, which instead of printing
 the matched PIDs, kills them.</p>
<p>Of course, we could also have used <code>xargs kill -9</code> here.</p>
<h2 id="an-api-and-a-tool">An API, and a Tool</h2>
<p><code>pgrep</code> and <code>pkill</code> kinda work, but they lose something nice about the original
<code>ps</code>: it can be used to get a lot of information about a process, not just its
PID and name.</p>
<p>Essentially, what we would like is a command that is able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Match processes using any of its properties (or &quot;fields&quot; as I called them
before. <code>pgrep</code> and <code>pkill</code> can do this (via various flags).</li>
<li>Display properties of interest. <code>ps</code> can do this (via its <code>-o</code> flag).</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover I&#39;d like a tool I can use at the command line easily. It should have
good defaults and enable frequent workflows easily, while supporting
customization.</p>
<p>But I&#39;d also like it to be a building block, either as a way to query processes
which I can use in elaborate scripts, or as a reusable component for other
interactive commands. As we&#39;ll see, there are a few niceties we can add to that
effect (match coloring, output truncation, ...).</p>
<p>I made this tool, and named it <code>nps</code> (of course).</p>
<h2 id="nps-basic-features"><code>nps</code>: Basic Features</h2>
<p>(Wanna see the code? <a href="https://gist.github.com/norswap/3506d2b46102c2f32f18acced0ecd798">It&#39;s here.</a>)</p>
<p>I want the command to match only my processes by default, but always also the
processes that don&#39;t have controlling terminals. The same switch as regular <code>ps</code>
(<code>-a</code>) can be added to get the processes from all users.</p>
<p>By default I only want the PID and the command name, because that&#39;s what I care
about 99% of the time. But I want the ability to request other informations,
this is done through the <code>-o</code> flag followed by a comma-separated set of field
specifiers described in <code>man ps</code>, the whole list of which can be obtained by
running <code>ps -L</code> or <code>nps -l</code>. So if you just need the PID, you&#39;d use <code>-o pid</code>. If
you just need to lookup some frequently used info, I included the verbose <code>-v</code>
flag, which acts like the <code>ps -j</code> flag, though implemented in terms of <code>-o
&#39;user, pid, ppid, pgid, sess, jobc, state, tt, time, command&#39;</code>, which are the
displayed fields.</p>
<p>In terms of matching, the command defaults to case-insensitive matching for
faster typing, but case-sensitivity can be obtained with the <code>-s</code> flag. <code>nps</code>
matches on the command name and PID, but it&#39;s possible to specify the matching
criteria using the <code>-m</code> flag (whose argument is similar to that of the <code>-o</code>
flag). As a special case, if you specify <code>-m pid</code>, <code>nps</code> only matches on entire
PIDs, as it&#39;s pretty much useless to match only part of the PID.</p>
<h2 id="improving-output">Improving Output</h2>
<p>Further improvements are concerned with output. <code>nps</code> detects whether its output
is directed towards a terminal, and if that&#39;s the case enable <code>grep</code> output
colorization so that you can quickly identify what was matched. You can also
specify the <code>--color</code> flag which forces colorizaton even when <code>nps</code> is piped to
a file or other process (this will leave terminal color codes in the output).</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>nps</code> follows after <code>ps</code> and clips command names if the output is a
terminal. However, this too can be controlled: use <code>--full</code> to always output
full command names, and <code>--clip</code> to always clip them. Note that the clip length
depends on the size of the terminal <code>nps</code> is running in!</p>
<p>Another related concern use is the inclusion of a header. By default, <code>ps</code> will
include a line with the name of all fields (columns) on display. This can be
useful on the terminal when displaying a lot of fields (e.g. <code>nps -v</code>) but not
otherwise, and while used in scripts it&#39;s a nuisance to be parsed away. <code>nps</code>
hides the header by default, but it can be included back with the <code>--header</code>
option.</p>
<h2 id="killing-processes-with-nps">Killing Processes with <code>nps</code></h2>
<p>Killing processes? Easy peezy, lemon squeezy, just add the <code>-k</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ nps -k sleep
# 60772 sleep 300</code></pre>
<p><code>nps</code> still prints the matched processes, which it also kills. Note it may fail
to kill the matched processes! If the exit code is 0 when using <code>-k</code>, it means
that all matched processes were killed (or that no process was matched).</p>
<p>As an aside, it&#39;s rather difficult to make the decision of what to return when
no process is matched. On the one hand, all <em>matched</em> processes (i.e. none) were
successfully killed. On the other hand, if you emit the command, you might
expect it to kill something. I opted for to return 0 when no process is matched
with <code>-k</code> (while usually it would be 1), because it makes the command
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">idempotent</a>, a very useful property when writing scripts.</p>
<p>It might be slightly better if <code>nps</code> reported on exactly which process were
killed and which lived on, though re-running <code>nps</code> (without <code>-k</code>) can easily
help determine which process are still alive, so all in all not a crucial
feature.</p>
<h2 id="argument-processing">Argument Processing</h2>
<p>It&#39;s interesting to look at how <code>nps</code> processes it&#39;s arguments. Unlike most
commands, options can be freely mixed with regular arguments (which are passed
to <code>grep</code> for matching purposes). One advantage is that if you want to kill a
process, you can first verify your query, then kill the process by appening the
<code>-k</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ nps foobar
# 59325 sleep 300
# # (press up, type &#39; -k&#39;)
$ nps foobar -k
# 59325 sleep 300</code></pre>
<p>If you use an unknown flag (e.g. <code>-z</code> or <code>--foobar</code>), <code>nps</code> will display its
help and exit with code 1. But what if you want to match flags — a totally
reasonable thing to do? Then you need to put those flags at the end, <em>after</em> the
special <code>--</code> separator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ nps -- -li
# 2043 bash -li
#  519 bash -li</code></pre>
<p>I think it would be <em>slightly</em> better if one could still have regular options
after. We could imagine to bracket sensitive options with <code>--</code>: <code>nps -- -li --
-k</code>, but then we also need a way to specify we want to match <code>--</code> itself,
probably as a special flag (e.g. <code>--sep</code>). This is a pretty big change to the
script for little benefits, so I&#39;m holding out for now.</p>
<p>All the &quot;search&quot; arguments are collected in order and merged (separated by a
whitespace). So in reality, it doesn&#39;t really make sense to have more than one,
though it can be convenient to type <code>nps sleep 300</code> rather than <code>nps &#39;sleep
300&#39;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="regular-expressions-and-return-code">Regular Expressions, and Return Code</h2>
<p>The final search parameter (obtained through argument processing as described in
the last section) will be used as a <a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/posix.html">Posix extended regular expression
(ERE)</a>.</p>
<p>This is something to keep in mind when you special characters which might need
to be quoted. For instance, to search for an interrogation mark: <code>nps &#39;\?&#39;</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, the following command will match and highlight all string literals
in running commands arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ nps &#39;&quot;.*&quot;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>As for the return code, <code>nps</code> returns 0 if it matched processes, 1 otherwise.
This is different when using the <code>-k</code> flag, as discussed above.</p>
<h2 id="potential-pitfalls">Potential Pitfalls</h2>
<p><code>nps</code> was only tested on macOS Catalina, and given how finicky these things are,
it&#39;s almost sure not to work out of the box on Linux.</p>
<p>In particular, the <code>script</code> command appears different in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/script.1.html">Linux</a>
than in <a href="https://www.unix.com/man-page/mojave/1/script/">macOS</a>.</p>
