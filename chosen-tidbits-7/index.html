<blockquote>
<p>What’s going on is that without some kind of direct experience to use as a
touchstone, people don’t have the context that gives them a place in their
minds to put the things you are telling them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The things you say often don&#39;t stick, and the few things that do stick are often
distorted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, most people aren&#39;t very good at visualizaing hypothetitcals, at imagining
what something they haven&#39;t experienced might be like if it were somewhat
different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drawing might help.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you create things that you can keep on the market at a very low cost
(including your time), you almost cannot fail. Worst case scenario is a slow
success.</p>
<p>When your running costs are high, time becomes your enemy. Your profits must
beat the clock, or you go bust.</p>
<p>When your running costs are negligible, time becomes your friend. You cannot go
bust, and the passage of time exposes you to luck 24/7.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you find yourself wondering, or just feeling, &quot;Why is everyone I wind up
dealing with an asshole?&quot; you might want to consider the possibility that you
have set up an asshole filter. Asshole filters are an extremely common
phenomenon, and an extremely common problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An asshole filter happens when you publicly promulgate a straitened contact
boundary and then don&#39;t enforce it; or worse, reward the people who transgress
it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: promulgate that mails mails must go through team mail, but still answer
your private emails or even <em>expedite</em> the requests your receive there, thereby
rewarding transgressors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wrote this post because of my endless frustration with my friends who have
the most slack in life also being the most risk averse. They have plenty of
savings but stay in soul-sucking jobs for years. They complain about the
monotony of social life but refuse to instigate a change. They don’t travel,
don’t do drugs, don’t pick fights, don’t flirt, don’t express themselves. They
don’t want to think about kids because their lives are just so comfortable and
why would you mess with that?</p>

<p><a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening">The Silence is Deafening</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Angry Alice tweets something obnoxious or unproductive, reasonable people
just scroll past it. If Alice develops a pattern of bad behavior, reasonable
people will just unfollow, mute, or block her. The result is that it&#39;s hard for
Alice to notice the silent majority of people who saw the trash fire and walked
away when they recognized that engaging would only fuel its flames.</p>
<p>It gets worse—Angry Alice only sees feedback from extremists, so she doesn&#39;t
receive more nuanced signals that might actually cause her to reflect on her
behavior. If no reasonable people give feedback, only the unreasonable people
are left. From Alice&#39;s perspective, the only people who disagree with her are
jerks.</p>
<p>This is a coordination problem. Reasonable people understand that if they join
the fray alone, they&#39;ll most likely be drowned out by the yelling, or worse
they&#39;ll get dragged deeper into it. As a result, they choose stay out of it.</p>
<p>A huge part of the problem is that digital spaces generally have no equivalent
of a disapproving glare. You&#39;re stuck choosing between staying silent and
entering the fray, with few options in between. If you have little reason to
believe that other reasonable people will back you up, you&#39;re going to stick
with the default: silence.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tolerance is not a moral precept, it&#39;s a peace treaty (or at least non-agression).</li>
<li>One can&#39;t tolerate the intolerant, that would be a suicide pact.</li>

<p>This thread illustrates that telling your children the functional lie that they
have bodily autonomy is exhausting to stick to.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1281406459855634437">Fuck Victimhood Identity</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that long ago I noticed that the less I saw and presented
myself as a victim, the less I was victimized. This kicked off a virtuous
cycle that I’m not going to jeopardize. Now my life is much improved, and I’ve
developed a very strong allergy to victim identity.</p>
<p>The spiral of victim identity is incredibly seductive. Once you step in it
your identity will be reinforced by everyone around you and your own
confirmation bias. I’ve seen this spiral claim people, groups, nations. It
didn’t make them better off, and it didn’t make them better.</p>
<p>Victimhood blinds you to the suffering of others. My dating life improved when
I stopped thinking about how women malign me and became able to understand
their own fears and frustrations with guys. Before, I literally couldn’t
fathom that dating can be hard for hot young women</p>
<p>Victimhood blinds you to your own mistakes, the only part you can change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone wants their suffering validated, but you will never get this
validation from those who hurt you if that’s what you seek. If you let go of
this doomed desire, you may eventually find the validation you crave among
friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>You shouldn’t have to argue about <em>how</em> you’re fighting, <em>while</em> you’re fighting.</p>
<p>Trying to do both at once is a quick way to compound your frustration with each
other and make things worse for everybody.</p>
<p>The smart thing to do is to schedule relationship maintenance in advance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My father has zero intellectual insecurities... It has never crossed his mind
to be concerned that the world thinks he’s an idiot. He’s not in that game. So
if he doesn’t understand something, he just asks you. He doesn’t care if he
sounds foolish. He will ask the most obvious question without any sort of
concern about it...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people are not willing to do this — looking stupid takes courage, and
sometimes it’s easier to just let things slide.</p>
<p>It is striking how many situations I am in where I start asking basic
questions, feel guilty for slowing the group down, and it turns out that
nobody understood what was going on to begin with (often people message me
privately saying that they’re relieved I asked), but I was the only one who
actually spoke up and asked about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://garybasin.com/one-week-project-management/">One Week Project Management</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting a big project is tricky. I usually have some sense of what needs to
be done, but my time estimates tend to be… a little off. There’s one thing
worse than underestimating the time it’ll take: doing unnecessary work. I hate
getting traction on a project only to realize that a bunch of work was wasted.</p>
<p>There’s a trick that often works for me: Rescope the project to complete it
within the next week. Even when unrealistic, trying to apply that tight
constraint can get you to notice things you wouldn’t otherwise. It forces me
to consider what is absolutely necessary and what can be skipped. It forces me
to spend one of my days planning so I know exactly what I need to execute.</p>
<p>[Parkinson’s Law] states that a project takes as much time as you allow it.
Once in a while, try allowing much less time than you think is necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My cynical view of humanity at large informs my sympathetic view of actual
humans. By the standards of horny status-obsessed murder monkeys, even my
outgroup enemies are often doing the best they can consider the fears and
insecurities that plague them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you believe that humans are by nature benign and kind and
are only &quot;corrupted&quot; by culture, you will have a very negative view of the
prevailing culture and most people. This will tempt you to dream of revolutions
or a return to some golden age.</p>
