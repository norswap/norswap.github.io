<p>I&#39;ve a set of instructions at home which open up great realms for the
improvement of technical writing. They begin, &#39;Assembly of Japanese bicycle
require great peace of mind.&#39;</p>

<p>Over the past few months, I have been reading
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a> by Robert Pirsig. This post
collects a few quotes on one of the big idea I got out of the book, namely that
doing good work is synonymous with tending to your peace of mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peace of mind isn&#39;t at all superficial [...] It&#39;s the whole thing. That which
produces it is good maintenance; that which disturbs it is poor maintenance.
[...] The ultimate test&#39;s always your own serenity. If you don&#39;t have this
when you start and maintain it while you&#39;re working you&#39;re likely to build
your personal problems right into the machine itself.</p>
<p>The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you. [...] If the machine
produces tranquility it&#39;s right. If it disturbs you it&#39;s wrong until either
the machine or your mind is changed. The test of the machine&#39;s always your own
mind. There isn&#39;t any other test.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometime look at a novice workman or a bad workman and compare his expression
with that of a craftsman whose work you know is excellent and you&#39;ll see the
difference. The craftsman isn&#39;t ever following a single line of instruction.
He&#39;s making decisions as he goes along. For that reason he&#39;ll be absorbed and
attentive to what he&#39;s doing even though he doesn&#39;t deliberately contrive this.
His motions and the machine are in a kind of harmony. He isn&#39;t following any set
of written instructions because the nature of the material at hand determines
his thoughts and motions, which simultaneously change the nature of the material
at hand. The material and his thoughts are changing together in a progression of
changes until his mind&#39;s at rest at the same time the material&#39;s right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I say inner peace of mind. It has no direct relationship to external
circumstances. It can occur to a monk in meditation, to a soldier in heavy
combat or to a machinist taking off that last ten-thousandth of an inch. It
involves unselfconsciousness, which produces a complete identification with
one&#39;s circumstances, and there are levels and levels of this identification
and levels and levels of quietness quite as profound and difficult of
attainment as the more familiar levels of activity.</p>
<p>This inner peace of mind occurs on three levels of understanding. Physical
quietness seems the easiest to achieve, although there are levels and levels of
this too, as attested by the ability of Hindu mystics to live buried alive for
many days. Mental quietness, in which one has no wandering thoughts at all,
seems more difficult, but can be achieved. But value quietness, in which one has
no wandering desires at all but simply performs the acts of his life without
desire, that seems the hardest.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve sometimes thought this inner peace of mind, this quietness is similar to if
not identical with the sort of calm you sometimes get when going fishing, which
accounts for much of the popularity of this sport. Just to sit with the line in
the water, not moving, not really thinking about anything, not really caring
about anything either, seems to draw out the inner tensions and frustrations
that have prevented you from solving problems you couldn&#39;t solve before and
introduced ugliness and clumsiness into your actions and thoughts.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t have to go fishing, of course, to fix your motorcycle. A cup of
coffee, a walk around the block, sometimes just putting off the job for five
minutes of silence is enough. When you do you can almost feel yourself grow
toward that inner peace of mind that reveals it all. That which turns its back
on this inner calm and the Quality it reveals is bad maintenance. That which
turns toward it is good. The forms of turning away and toward are infinite but
the goal is always the same.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Zen Buddhists talk about &quot;just sitting,&quot; a meditative practice in which the idea
of a duality of self and object does not dominate one&#39;s consciousness. What I&#39;m
talking about here in motorcycle maintenance is &quot;just fixing,&quot; in which the
idea of a duality of self and object doesn&#39;t dominate one&#39;s consciousness. When
one isn&#39;t dominated by feelings of separateness from what he&#39;s working on, then
one can be said to &quot;care&quot; about what he&#39;s doing. That is what caring really is,
a feeling of identification with what one&#39;s doing.</p>
<p>So the thing to do when working on a motorcycle, as in any other task, is to
cultivate the peace of mind which does not separate one&#39;s self from one&#39;s
surroundings. When that is done successfully then everything else follows
naturally. Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right
thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work
which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the
center of it all.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The social values are right only if the individual values are right. The place
to improve the world is first in one&#39;s own heart and head and hands, and then
work outward from there. other people can talk about how to expand the destiny
of mankind. I just want to talk about how to fix a motorcycle.</p>
