<h2 id="lifting">Lifting</h2>
<p>I followed the powerlifting DUP protocol outlined in <a href="/weight-training-7">my previous post</a>,
except I lowered deadlift reps to 5x and 8x.</p>
<p>I ran the protocol for approximately 14 weeks, before I was forced to stop
because the gym closed down for another coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>The timing wasn&#39;t too unfortunate, however. My TTP (time to peek) on the bench
press and deadlift was approximately 8 weeks. I understand from the RTS
litterature that&#39;s a pretty usual timeframe.</p>
<p>My squat however progressed more slowly. Might not have pushed myself enough,
but I&#39;m very careful with squat form as it&#39;s easier to fudge up. That was still
going up as I was forced to stop.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#39;ve hit new personal records on all big lifts (sets * reps *
weight in kg):</p>
<ul>
<li>Bench: 3x3x110, 3x6x100, 3x12x77.5</li>
<li>Squat: 3x3x157.5, 3x6x135, 3x12x95</li>
<li>Deadlift: 3x3.185, 3x5x165, 3x8x135</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cutting">Cutting</h2>
<p>I said last time I was doing all this while going on a slight cut. I&#39;m not too
sure how that went. I stopped tracking my calories (which I&#39;d been doing for ~2
years at that point) to save a bit of time and hassle.</p>
<p>The worst-cast scenario was to cut ~200 calories on my three weekly workout
days, and eat at maintenance the rest of the time. This comes to 600 kcal/week,
or approximately one kilo over the duration of the program.</p>
<p>Since I expected body recomposition (fat loss, muscle gain), I also skipped out
on weighting myself every day, but punctual measurements seem to indicate my
weight was more or less maintained.</p>
<p>The progress on the lifts is mostly neural adaptation, but I think it&#39;s likely
some amount of muscle gain occurred too, seemingly validating that body
recomposition did indeed occur.</p>
<h2 id="forward">Forward</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve started re-running home workouts. I&#39;m not giving specifics, the idea is the
same as <a href="/weight-training-6">last time</a>, but with a different exercise selection.</p>
<p>I&#39;m interested in trying some bodyweight movements. I&#39;ve experimented with
handstands against a wall (not too sure of my balacing skills). Also with the
<a href="https://www.google.be/search?tbm=isch&q=dragon%20flag">dragon flag</a>, but I don&#39;t have a good enough setup to accomodate it indoors.</p>
<p>I have some distance to go where I want to be with my cut, so I&#39;m going to
continue to cut moderately. I&#39;ll be tracking again and aiming for a ~1200
kcal/week deficit at first.</p>
