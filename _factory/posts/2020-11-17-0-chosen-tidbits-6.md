[100 Ways to Live Better](https://putanumonit.com/2019/12/30/100-ways-to-live-better/)

> Any life advice that isn’t given to you personally is not designed to be

[reversed]: https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/

> If you're not having fun then just leave.

> "I know we were just introduced, but I forgot your name." "I saw the email you
> sent me last month, I just procrastinated and forgot." "This is the best
> effort I was realistically going to make." Try it, it's liberating.

> If your spouse, friend, or family member is doing something dumb but not

> When you're home alone, blast some music and dance. Don't think about your
> body, just focus on the music. Then do the exact same thing when you're at a
> dance party.

> Get massages, give massages. You don't have to know what you're doing to

> Stop lurking; write that comment. You know the saying about letting people

[Some Useful Probability Facts for Systems Programming](https://theartofmachinery.com/2020/01/27/systems_programming_probability.html)

> If an outcome has probability 1/N for each "attempt", and it is attempted N
> times, the probability it will occur at least once stabilizes at 0.62 as N
> increases.

> Suppose you throw N balls randomly (independently and one at a time) into N
> buckets. On average, a bit over a third (1/e) of the buckets will stay empty, a
> bit over a third (1/e again) will have exactly one ball, and the remaining
> quarter or so (1 − 2/e) will contain multiple balls.

> If a group of things are randomly shuffled, a bit of over a third (1/e) of the
> time there’ll be no fixed points (something that lands in the same position), a
> bit of over a third (1/e) of the time there’ll be just one fixed point, and the
> remaining quarter or so of the time there’ll be two or more.

> Let’s look at the common “loot box” mechanism. Specifically, suppose there are
> 10 collector items (say, one for each hero in a franchise) that are sold in
> blind boxes. Let’s take the fairest case in which there are no rare items and
> each item has an equal 1/10 chance of being in a given box. How many boxes will a
> collector buy on average before getting a complete set? This is the called the
> coupon collector’s problem, and for 10 items the answer is about 29.
>
> The answer to the coupon collector’s problem is a bit more than N * ln(N) (add N/2
> for some more accuracy).
>
> The coupon collector’s problem hints at why the loot box mechanism is so
> powerful. The N balls in N buckets rule tells us that the collector will have
> about two thirds of the items after buying 10 boxes. It feels like the collector
> is most of the way there, and it would be a shame to give up and let so much
> progress go to waste, but actually 10 boxes is only about a third of the
> expected number of boxes needed.

[40 powerful concepts for understanding the world](https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1225561131122597896?s=09)

> Ergodicity: A die rolled 100 times has equal probabilities to 100 dice rolled
> once; rolling a die is “ergodic”. But if the die gets chipped after 10 throws
> so it’s likelier to roll 4, then 1 die 100 times =/= 100 dice once
> (non-ergodic). Many treat non-ergodic systems as ergodic.

See [another good explanation](https://larspsyll.wordpress.com/2016/11/23/what-is-ergodicity-2/).

> Simpson’s Paradox: A trend can appear in groups of data but disappear when these
> groups are combined. This effect can easily be exploited by limiting a dataset
> so that it shows exactly what one wants it to show. Thus: beware of even the
> strongest correlations. ([illustration](https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1225561191470260227))

> Condorcet Paradox: a special instance of Simpson’s paradox applied to elections,
> in which a populace prefers candidate A to candidate B, candidate B to C, and
> yet candidate C to A. This occurs because the majority that favors C is
> misleadingly divided among different groups.

> Concept Creep: As a social issue such as racism or sexual harassment becomes
> rarer, people react by expanding their definition of it, creating the illusion
> that the issue is actually getting worse.

> Streetlight Effect: People tend to get their information from where it’s easiest
> to look.

> Woozle Effect: An article makes a claim without evidence, is then cited by
> another, which is cited by another, and so on, until the range of citations
> creates the impression that the claim has evidence, when really all articles are
> citing the same uncorroborated source.

> Tocqueville Paradox: As the living standards in a society rise, the people’s
> expectations of the society rise with it. The rise in expectations eventually
> surpasses the rise in living standards, inevitably resulting in disaffection
> (and sometimes populist uprisings).

> Nirvana Fallacy: When people reject a thing because it compares unfavorably to
> an ideal that in reality is unattainable. E.g. condemning capitalism due to
> the superiority of imagined socialism, condemning ruthlessness in war due to
> imagining humane (but unrealistic) ways to win.

[Socratic Grilling](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/06/socratic-grilling/)

In a dialog with a lot of questions from a student, it might sound as though the
student is nitpicking and/or challenging the teacher, when he's really just
trying to understand.

[This Extended Mind Again: We Don’t Know What a Human Being

> If it is true that… many of our beliefs are actually _external_ to our internal

[Concept: Kayfabe](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11783)

> Because professional wrestling is a simulated sport, all competitors who face
> each other in the ring are actually close collaborators who must form a closed
> system (called "a promotion") sealed against outsiders. With external
> competitors generally excluded, antagonists are chosen from within the promotion
> and their ritualized battles are largely negotiated, choreographed, and
> rehearsed at a significantly decreased risk of injury or death. With outcomes
> predetermined under Kayfabe, betrayal in wrestling comes not from engaging in
> unsportsmanlike conduct, but by the surprise appearance of actual sporting
> behavior. Such unwelcome sportsmanship which "breaks Kayfabe" is called
> "shooting" to distinguish it from the expected scripted deception called
> "working".

> [Wrestling evolved out of "catch".] Typical matches could last hours with no
> satisfying action, or end suddenly with crippling injuries to a promising
> athlete in whom much had been invested. This highlighted the close
> relationship between two paradoxical risks which define the category of
> activity which wrestling shares with other human spheres:
>
> A) Occasional but Extreme Peril for the participants.
> B) General: Monotony for both audience and participants.
>
> Kayfabrication (the process of transition from reality towards Kayfabe) arises
> out of attempts to deliver a dependably engaging product for a mass audience
> while removing the unpredictable upheavals that imperil participants. As such
> Kayfabrication is a dependable feature of many of our most important systems
> which share the above two characteristics such as war, finance, love, politics
> and science.

> At the point Kayfabe was forced to own up to the fact that professional
> wrestling contained no sport whatsoever, it did more than avoid being regulated
> and taxed into oblivion. Wrestling discovered the unthinkable: its audience did
> not seem to require even a thin veneer of realism. Professional wrestling had
> come full circle to its honest origins by at last moving the responsibility for
> deception off of the shoulders of the performers and into the willing minds of
> the audience.
>
> Kayfabe, it appears, is a dish best served client-side.

[Concept: Russell Conjugation](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27181)

> As the theory goes, it is not that we don’t have our own opinions so much as
> that we have too many contradictory ones, and it is generally our emotional
> state alone which determines on which ones we will predicate action or inaction.
>
> Russell Conjugation (or “emotive conjugation”) is a presently obscure
> construction from linguistics, psychology and rhetoric which demonstrates how
> our rational minds are shielded from understanding the junior role factual
> information generally plays relative to empathy in our formation of opinions.

> Where words can be considered “synonyms” if they carry the same factual content
> (I) regardless of the emotional content (II). This however leads to the peculiar
> effect that the synonyms for a positive word like “whistle-blower” cannot be
> used in its place as they are almost universally negative (with “snitch,”
> “fink,” “tattletale” being representative examples). This is our first clue that
> something is wrong, or at least incomplete with our concept of synonym requiring
> an upgrade to distinguish words that may be content synonyms but emotional
> antonyms.

Other examples:
- _firm_ vs _obstinate_ vs _pig-headed_
- _death tax_ vs _estate tax_
- _illegal alien_ vs _undocumented migrant_

[You're a Slave to Money, Then You
Die](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/youre-a-slave-to-money-then-you-die/)

> Like the student and other forms of personal debt that prepare undergraduates
> to say two words — "Yes, boss" — the ideal of the entrepreneurial self serves
> a fundamentally disciplinary function: reinforcing the precarious nature of
> work in today’s digitalized, low-wage, precariously employed, and increasingly
> automated capitalism, one in which you are casually expendable and which
> places a premium on everlasting metamorphosis: upgrade your skills, your
> profile, your resume. But don’t worry, complain, or God help you, call a
> union: losing your job or seeing your skill set rendered obsolescent is an
> opportunity for "growth," creativity, empowerment. When your own exploitation
> can be recast as a project rather than a problem—a source of fulfillment
> rather than an instance of injustice—then solidarity with others can be
> vilified as conformism, the herd instinct of normies, the last refuge of
> losers and mediocrities.

[The Value is In The Tails](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/freWTrdfxwpn4imwn/the-value-is-in-the-tails)

> When I asked him why he bet on Trump, he said he didn't really understand
> American politics, but that it seemed extremely complicated, with random things
> like whether it rains in certain parts of Pennsylvania potentially being
> important. If it's extremely complicated and arbitrary, then it's probably also
> hard to model. The projections he saw had the most likely outcome being a
> moderate win by Hilary, but since he didn't trust the models, he figured the
> value was in the tails: the models are likely off, which likely affects the
> tails more than the mean. So a landslide win by Hilary or a Trump victory seemed
> undervalued by gambling markets. He wished he could hedge his bets by betting on
> both outcomes (as opposed to a moderate Hilary win), but the only option he had
> was to bet on Trump to win.
>
> This logic has stuck with me ever since: in the face of large uncertainty, we're
> probably getting the tails wrong more than the mean. The value is in the tails.

[Choosing The Zero Point](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rMfpnorsMoRwyn4iP/choosing-the-zero-point)

You can decide what state of affairs counts as neutral, and what counts as
positive or negative.

e.g. animal suffering: you can define the zero point as "animal shouldn't suffer
more than if humans were there" and if you accept it, that makes you a monster.
You could frame the zero point as the current situation, and every improvement
you make as a net gain.

[People Hate Non-Shockers](https://deluks917.wordpress.com/2020/04/15/people-hate-non-shockers/)

> > A society has the following rules:
> >
> > — Everyone must publicly electro-shock themselves 8 hours per day.
> >
> > — If you see someone not shocking themselves then you must kill them
> >
> > — Anyone who violates the second rule must also be killed. The same is true for
> >   all meta levels. Non-killers of non-killers of ... of non-shockers must be
> >   killed.
>
> This equilibrium can get locked in even if every single person dislikes it. I
> think similar but weaker dynamics apply all the time in normal life. Why is
> there so much hyperbolic hate direct against furries?
>
> Most are people are very repressed. Society has a norm that you need to keep
> ‘low status’ or ‘cringey’ aspects of yourself private. Furries often violate
> these norms. People feel the urge to punish them. And people often feel
> uncomfortable even being seen as being tolerant. Afterall tolerators are at risk
> too!
>
> I don’t claim this is the only dynamic at play. People also like to look down on
> official low-status groups to feel better about themselves. Notably, even if
> people don’t intrinsically want to punish non-shockers may still hate them. If
> you let me see you not shocking yourself now you have put me at risk unless I
> punish you!

>
> It strikes me as socially inherited bloatware that causes tedious lag, which
> ironically prevents you from being awesome. When people say things like “just be

> bloatware.

> Wonderfully, it seems to me that lots of people who end up Doing Important Work
> often got there by being playful and curious. Richard Feynman, for example, got
> his Nobel prize from piddling around with spinning plates. And the point isn’t
> to get the Nobel prize, the point is to enjoy the piddling.

Paul Graham:

> Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you
> enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you’d like to
> like.

---

> Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment.
> The more experiments you make, the better. What if they are a little coarse and
> you may get your coat soiled or torn? What if you do fail, and get fairly rolled
> in the dirt once or twice? Up again; you shall never be so afraid of a tumble.

[Creationism Unchallenged](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/28/creationism-unchallenged/)

Creationism was cancer and the most dangerous thing in the early 2000s. Yet
still as many people believe it. Yet we don't talk about anymore, and it's not
been an apocalypse. Talking about it hasn't hindered or helped.

Maybe it's the same with the issue of the day.

> I see people using rivers of ink to fight the modern equivalents of
> creationists. Pizzagaters, flat-earthers, moon-hoaxers, QAnon, deep-staters,
> people who say the coronavirus is a bioweapon, Alex Jones. Are they sure it’s
> not equally useless? Equally counterproductive?

> Sleep is one of the biggest factors.

> It's also important to optimize your workspace as much as possible. Get a huge
> monitor, a comfy chair, and a nice desk. Get some plants. Spend the time
> customizing your computer to make it easy and efficient to use. These are basic
> things but they really matter a lot.

> When you sit down to work, your task must be connected to a goal that matters to
> you and it must be an effective lever.

> When you are at your best and are working on something that matters, that's when
> it's time to step on the gas and work hard. The amount of valuable output you
