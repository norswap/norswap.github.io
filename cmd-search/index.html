      <h1 class="post-title">Effective Command Line Searching</h1>
      <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2018</span>
<p>I do keep a fair amount of information inside text files - this is how I
organize myself, keep track of what I&#39;ve read, etc.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I need to search these files by content to retrieve some
information, or remind myself of something I read earlier. Hence the need for
software that does just that.</p>
<p>So far, I had settled on <a href="https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack/">Agent Ransack</a> on Windows and <a href="https://www.houdah.com/tembo/">Tembo</a> on OS X.
However, I was looking for something a bit more snappy, hence the idea of using
a command line tool.</p>
<p>I expect the reader will be familiar with the venerable <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/">grep</a>, but it turns out
there are a whole lot more tools that can be used.</p>
<p>The most useful resource I found online was <a href="https://beyondgrep.com/feature-comparison/">this comparison</a> of tools, which
compares (at the time of writing), <a href="https://beyondgrep.com/"><code>ack</code></a>, <a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/ag/"><code>ag</code></a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep"><code>git-grep</code></a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/"><code>GNU grep</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>rg</code></a>.</p>
<p>After a glance, I was really tempted to use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep (<code>rg</code>)</a>, which seems
to be the fastest of the bunch, has well-rounded features and nice
documentations.</p>
<p>However, it lacked a vital feature for me: multi-line matching. I store a lot of
text formatted to hard-line-wrap at 80 characters, and I want to be able to
search for word groups accros line boundaries. So ultimately I settled on <a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/ag/">the
silver searcher (<code>ag</code>)</a>, which is great as well.</p>
<h2 id="effective-selecting">Effective Selecting</h2>
<p>Additionally, I also wanted to try <a href="https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta">selecta</a>, a command line tool by <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Gary
Bernhardt</a>.</p>
<p>What it does is read lines from the input stream and allow you to scroll these
lines on the command line, ultimately selecting one. If this description is
unclear, check the animated gif on the <a href="https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta">github page</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately selecta is Unix-only, however there are a few clones and I ended
up settling on the multi-platform <a href="https://github.com/rschmitt/heatseeker">heatseeker</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of what I can do with <code>ag</code> and heatseeker (<code>hs</code>):</p>
<pre><code>em $(ag -l parser | hs)
</code></pre>
<p>Or the Windows equivalent (assuming you have <code>xargs</code> installed, it comes with
<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> and even Git):</p>
<pre><code>ag -l parser | hs | xargs em
</code></pre>
<p>What I&#39;m doing is that I&#39;m searching for the string &quot;parser&quot; in the current
directory. The <code>-l</code> flag says to only print the file name (not the line number)
of matches. Then heatseeker is used for the selection, and once the selection is
done, the file opens in Emacs (<code>em</code> is my <a href="https://github.com/norswap/.emacs.d">custom Emacs launching
script</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, this could be encapsulated in a batch script or bash function in
order to be even more convenient.</p>
<h2 id="filename-search">Filename Search</h2>
<p>Just to be clear, the article is about searching inside text files. However, I
also often want to search files by name.</p>
<p>To do this, I use GUI programs. On Windows, the best is <a href="https://www.voidtools.com/">Everything</a>. I have
this handy program hotkeyed to <code>Win+S</code> and I use it all the time to quickly
navigate to a file.</p>
<p>OS X has unfortunately nothing as good as that. The main problem is that most
search programs seems to rely on the Spotlight engine, which is flaky in a
couple of places. Most aggravating for me, Spotlight will not search inside
dot-directories (e.g. <code>.config</code>). It&#39;s also not possible to formulate queries as
easily as in Everything. I think partial path matching is not possible for
instance. The search program that don&#39;t use the Spotlight engine are somehow
even worse.</p>
<p>In the absence of a real solution, <a href="https://www.houdah.com/tembo/">Tembo</a> is also able to search on file names
on OS X. It&#39;s not a patch on Everything, but it&#39;s better than nothing
(accidental pun!).</p>
<p>In the rare cases where I want to search on the command line, I can either use
the venerable <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html"><code>find</code></a> or the use <code>-g</code> flag of <code>ag</code>.</p>
<h2 id="android">Android</h2>
<p>I also have a bunch of text files synced on my phone, and on the rare occassion
I need to make a search on the go, I use the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.sblo.pandora.aGrep&hl=en&rdid=jp.sblo.pandora.aGrep">aGrep</a> application. I have also
tried <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.docsearch&hl=en">DocSearch</a>, but the user experience was less pleasant.</p>
