      <h1 class="post-title">Static Website Generation, Incrementally</h1>
      <span class="post-date">23 Oct 2018</span>
<p>The piece of Javascript that generates this very website has to be one of the
most zen piece of code I ever wrote. I wrote about it in <a href="http://norswap.com/ribosome-static-site/">an article back in
2016</a>. It has served me well since, and hasn&#39;t broken on me the way
that I would have expected something written in Ruby to do.</p>
<p>Yet not all was perfect. The whole website took mabye 15-20 seconds to generate,
and complete generation was the only option.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it was my project to implement incremental generation: only
re-generate the parts of the content that have actually changed. I also wanted a
<em>watch</em> feature: the ability to auto-regenerate content whenever I saved a
source file.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve achieved these objectives, and this blog post is about that. Before I dive
in, however, a remark with the benefit of hindsight. Should I have done this at
all? The <em>watch</em> feature had to be done, but otherwise, if my objective was to
speed up generation, maybe I should have gone and figured exactly why the
generation process was so slow... because 15-20 seconds for ~50 blog posts is
VERY slow, even for Javascript. I haven&#39;t done that, but I think I should have.</p>
<p>Now for the good part. <a href="https://github.com/norswap/norswap.github.io/blob/f643a18ef7681ecfc176265ae66629decc19ec1e/.factory/generate.js">Here&#39;s the resulting code.</a></p>
<p>The process started with a lot of refactoring: pounding what was essentially a
linear script into functions that could be reused.</p>
<h2 id="asyncawait-fun">Async/Await Fun</h2>
<p>As part of that refactoring, I also made sure that all the calls that touched
the file systems were now using <a href="https://javascript.info/async">promises with async and await</a>. This was
mostly for fun and my own education, because <a href="http://sustrik.github.io/ribosome/">Ribosome</a> — the templating library
I use — is fully synchronous. I also think it might be responsible for the slow
execution times (or maybe just my use of it which involve writing then reading
to a temp file once per post), but that&#39;s an investigation for another day.</p>
<p>I think async is great however, although there were a few pitfalls I fell right
in. As you may know, using async functions guarantees linear execution without
crazy callback pyramid of doom... if you use the <code>await</code> keyword! It&#39;s easy to
forget it and it causes no warning (by design, this is not a complain).</p>
<p>Async also required me to get ... creative in one instance. The package I use
for watching the file system takes a callback to which it supplies an array of
events that occured since last time the callback was called. The problem is that
this callback is never <code>await</code>ed, even if it returns a promise. As such, if you
do async stuff within that callback (and I did), it&#39;s very possible that the
package will fire another callback before the last one finished processing. This
was not acceptable to me: each set of filesystem changes had to be fully
processed before the processing of the nex tone began.</p>
<p>Here is how I solved it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Javascript">async function watch()
{
    let lock = Promise.resolve()
    ...
    const watching = await watcher(..., async (events) =&gt; {
        let resolve
        const old_lock = lock
        lock = new Promise((r, _) =&gt; resolve = r)
        await old_lock
        ...
        // process events
        ...
        resolve()
    })
    watching.start()
}</code></pre>
<p>Basically, each invocation of the callback creates a &quot;lock&quot; object, which is an
unfullfilled promise. It then waits on the previous lock to be fullfilled. Only
when it has finished processing does if fullfill (<code>resolve</code>) its own lock.
Notice that since code is never executed in parallel, it&#39;s perfectly safe to use
a &quot;global&quot; variable to save the last lock. Each successive callback invocation
creates a copy of the last lock then replaces it with its own. This ensures that
only a single callback may be waiting on a lock, and thus there is no data race:
the callbacks are serialized neatly, each waiting on the previous callback&#39;s
lock to be fullfilled.</p>
<h2 id="incremental-index-pages">Incremental Index Pages</h2>
<p>Architecturally, the big challenge was how to regen index pages without having
to reprocess every blog post ever.</p>
<p>The problem occurs for instance when you add a new post: all the index pages
have to have their post shifted backwards one unit. Reparsing the HTML would
have been a possibility, although I didn&#39;t once contemplate it. It&#39;s still a bit
ugly in my mind as the HTML page is a product, not a source. But it might
actually have worked.</p>
<p>What I ended up doing instead is create a file called <code>posts.json</code> that
serialized all the needed post data. This includes title, date, layout type, as
well as content for (a) posts that need to appear in the <a href="/atom.xml">atom feed</a> and (b)
posts whose layout is <code>brief</code>, i.e. posts whose content appears directly on the
index pages.</p>
<p>I also pushed the vice further, and only regenerated the index pages that
actually needed to. For instance, if I removed the very first post, only the
last index page would have to be regenerated. I didn&#39;t push this as hard as I
could have: for instance renaming a post will also cause all subsequent index
pages to be regenerated, when there is really no need to.</p>
<h2 id="filesystem-watching-frustrations">Filesystem Watching Frustrations</h2>
<p>The only frustrating thing I had to deal with was the filesystem watching
libraries.</p>
<p>This was further compounded by a dumb mistake of my own which made my whole
prior evaluation of libraries irrelevant. I don&#39;t even remember what it was I
did, but it caused me to think the libraries were malfunctioning while it was me
that was actually being a dumbass.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are the libraries that I considered, and should reconsider at some
point in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar">Chokidar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nsfw">nsfw</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atom/watcher">@atom/watcher</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fb-watchman">fb-watchman</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the built-in <code>fs.watch</code>, but the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar">Chokidar</a> page reports that it
has a slew of issues, which I am inclined to believe.</p>
<p>I ended up going with <code>nsfw</code> as it was the one I had setup when I finally
understood my mistake. However I cannot recommend it, it works quite shittily,
at the very least on Windows. Amongst the issue I had to contend with and hack
around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate events.</li>
<li>File renaming causes a creation event on the old file and a modify event on
the new file (in addition to the renaming event).</li>
<li>File creation also causes a modify event on the created file (in addition to
the creation event).</li>
</ul>
<p>These may just be <code>fs.watch</code> issues that <code>nsfw</code> didn&#39;t guard against though...</p>
<p><code>nsfw</code> also has different dependencies for Windows and MacOS, which causes some
trouble for me, as I have my code on Dropbox so that I may seamlessly switch
from my laptop to my desktop without requiring a dirty commit (it&#39;s on Git as
well, don&#39;t worry).</p>
<p>Also note that the <code>@atom/watcher</code> is different from the original <code>watcher</code> lib,
which doesn&#39;t build anymore. I think the build script is the only thing that has
been altered however.</p>
<p><code>fb-watchman</code> required an OS-specific software install outside of NPM.</p>
<p>One of the tools required some Windows build tools to be installed globally (you
could install it locally, but it&#39;s huge). Another one (or the same, I don&#39;t
remember) required a flag to ask for Python 2.7.</p>
<p>All in all, this was a bit of a headache.</p>
<p>If you were to try one of those, my hunch and the above tells me to go with
Chokidar.</p>
