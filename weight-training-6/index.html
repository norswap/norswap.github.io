      <span class="post-date">22 Jul 2020</span>
<p>Previously: <a href="/weight-training">One</a> / <a href="/weight-training-2">Two</a> / <a href="/weight-training-3">Three</a> / <a href="/weight-training-4">Four</a> / <a href="/weight-training-5">Five</a></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a long overdue post on how I trained at home during quarantine. In fact,
as I write this, I&#39;ve just begun going back to the gym since one week.</p>
<h2 id="training-home">Training @Home</h2>
<p>I saw the quarantine as an opportunity to experiment with at-home training,
something that had been in the back of my mind for a while.</p>
<p>With no clear best candidate to adopt for at-home training, I decided to adapt
<a href="/weight-training-5">my previous training regimen</a> (based on Jeremy Ethier&#39;s <a href="https://my.builtwithscience.com/courses">Intermediate
Build</a> program) for home work.</p>
<p>(In fact, Jeremy ended up releasing an adapted version of his program for home,
which includes barbell, bodyweight and resistance band versions of all workouts.
But that wasn&#39;t available when I started quarantining.)</p>
<p>The experiment was pretty successful. I was able to put on some weight, and get
past a sticking point I had between 89 and 90 kgs.</p>
<p>In fact it was a bit too successful. The program calls for 5 workouts a week,
but I ended up burning out after a couple weeks, and scaling back to 3 workouts
a week while keeping the 5-workouts rotation. Probably not the most optimal
thing to do, but eh — choosing exercises is hard.</p>
<p>Home training can mean widely different things. I already owned a <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B019H12VG8">pullup bar</a>
and a couple <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B074MTMMWH">resistance bands</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07D35TXXX">tubular bands</a>. Additionally, I decided to
invest in a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B0828DJYQR">adaptable dumbbells</a>. Those are pretty pricey: the &quot;cheap&quot;
(as in both price and potentially, make) version I bought ran me 100€ for each,
while the <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B078HDGG7H">original brand product</a> is 250€. Ultimately, it proved to be a good
investment: they held up until now and proved really invaluable and enabling me
to perform more exercises.</p>
<p>Towards the end of quarantine I also bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B078KCM53F/">suspension band</a> (also known as
&quot;TRX band&quot;, after the most popular brand). This is super handy for back
workouts, which are othewise a bit awkwards excepted for pullups. Really
recommended if you&#39;re going to work your back at home.</p>
<p>The program went through multiple slight iterations — I&#39;m just going to
reproduce the final version below, with links to demonstrations for all the
exercises. A few comments on its evolution will follow.</p>
<h2 id="the-program">The Program</h2>
<p>Note: No rep counts are included. Since I have only limited ability to overload
the movement with weights at home, most of these should simply be &quot;as many as
possible&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="evolution">Evolution</h2>
<p>The most notable evolution the program went through is that most most exercises
that have two sets used to have three, but I reduced when deloading after
burning out on the early version. Subsequently I simply increase the volume on
those two sets instead of adding a third one. I&#39;m not sure this is the best
thing to do (3 sets is often seen as somewhat of a standard), but the main
benefit was helping get the length of the workouts under control.</p>
<p>As already mentionned, I bought the suspension band only partway through, and
that means that other exercises had to be selected for the back before that.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the exercises I tried: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYS-rSmedCE?t=346">towel row</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/mjnseqLiVXM?t=167">superman</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/mjnseqLiVXM?t=40">back widow</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQjyeQQDIs">resistance band seated row</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cszJcRz5UB0">reverse pushups</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmi9NXKw1fU">overhand/underhand table
rows</a>, tubular band face pulls, band-assisted pullups, scapular pullups.</p>
<p>There was also some variation on the other workouts, though less. Most notably I
did some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4mCllu5Qps">kitchen counter dips</a>, and some of the exerecises outlined in this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKdR83QGIcg">chest workout</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I&#39;ve said a couple times, this probably isn&#39;t the most optimized home
workout. 5 workouts over 11 days is probably too long of a rotation. There are
too many exercises, and it would be better to have a bit more sets per exercise.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I got positive results out of it, and it was pretty good
given the circumstances. If anything, my biggest success here was to be able to
back down when I felt the onset of fatigue and overtraining — which has been
hard for me in the past.</p>
<p>As for what&#39;s next, I&#39;ve started to do all the big lifts (bench, squat &amp;
deadlift) again, three times per week, all the while cutting on a moderate
deficit. This might be a terrible idea, but I&#39;m giving it a try. More on that
soon (hopefully).</p>
