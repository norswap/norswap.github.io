      <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2021</span>
<p>in <a href="/bonds-2//finance">Finance</a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the <a href="/bonds-2//bonds">last post</a> I explained the basics of the bonds market, the
difference the interest rate and the yield, etc.</p>
<p>I also mentioned that in February, yields soared from 1.13% to 1.6%, causing a
large upset in the stock market as well. In this post, I want to look at why
this happens, and how the effect spilled over to the stock market.</p>
<p>Be warned that this post is a bit more about figuring things out than presenting
orderly facts. I&#39;m far from mastering all the variables here, so take everything
with a grain of salt.</p>
<h2 id="the-fundamentals">The Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The basic explanation of why the bond prices dropped precipitously and the yield
soared is pretty simple: people expect US dollar inflation, meaning rising
prices, hence a currency with less purchasing power. Inflation does all kinds of
bad things to the economy (which we will examine shortly) and so the federal
reserve tries to keep it subdued. It does this mostly by increasing the interest
rates it pays on newly emitted bonds. This decreases bond prices and increases
bond yield.</p>
<p>If it&#39;s not clear to you why the federal reserve increasing the interest rate on
bonds leads to falling bonds price and thus higher yields, see <a href="/bonds-2//bonds">the previous
article</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that government bonds are the ultimate safe investment. Raising the
interest rate leads to a bunch of other interest rates in the economy to
increase (for instance, on savings accounts), which promotes savings, which
reduces the amount of money circulating in the economy. The federal reserve also
uses the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp">federal funds rate</a> to achieve this objective. (Sorry if this is not
very precise. I wish I had a better understanding of the mechanics here.)</p>
<p>Reducing the amount of money circulating is important, because inflation is
caused by a changing balance between demand and supply. When there is a lot of
money chasing few goods, prices increase, and you have inflation. You reduce
inflation by decreasing the amount of money in circulation, or by increasing the
amount of good produced.</p>
<p>People expect inflation, of course, because Joe Biden signed a stimulus bill
where the government would spend 1.9T$ (that&#39;s trillion). For reference, the
total market capitalization (summing the value of every share) of the S&amp;P 500 is
about 30T$. Then there is a 2T$ infrastructure bill being debated right now, and
there might some more down the line. When you inject so much money in the
economy, inflation is not exactly unexpected. There is however much debate about
how high inflation will go, and how transitory or persistent the increase will
be. The federal reserve currently maintains that the inflation rate might rise
over 2%, but that this should only be temporary.</p>
<p>The only uncertainty in all of this is if, or whether <em>when</em>, the federal reserve
would increase the interest rate in response to inflation increasing. The price
move caused such an uproar because the federal reserved had been saying (and has
kept saying since) that they don&#39;t expect to increase the rate anytime soon and
that it&#39;s fine if &quot;the economy runs hot&quot; and inflation is temporarily increased.
The bond market seemed to be saying that either the situation would be worse
than the fed expected, forcing its hand, or that, under pressure from the
markets, it couldn&#39;t walk the line (as seen in the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp">2013 &quot;taper
tantrum&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>Once the move was initiated, however, it made sense for most people to follow
suit. Whether you&#39;re a trader or a long-term investor in long-term bonds, you
expect the rates to increase eventually, meaning it will be profitable for you
to sell your bonds and buy new higher-rate bonds. If the bond price starts to
drop, you should therefore sell. In fact, the only reasons not to sell are if
either you don&#39;t believe the rates will increase or if you&#39;re contractually
obligated to hold bonds instead of cash.</p>
<p>But on top of this strong fundamental reason, there were a few other catalysts
and technical details that can help explain the sudden move.</p>
<p>A first catalyst (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/chaotic-treasury-selloff-fueled-by-50-billion-position-unwind">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in April, the Federal Reserve tweaked its rules to exempt Treasuries from
banks’ supplementary leverage ratios — allowing them to expand their balance
sheets with U.S. debt. But that relief ends March 31 and what happens next is
something of a mystery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it was expected that by April 2021, banks would have offloaded excess bonds
to get back in cash and satisfy the re-tightened rules.</p>
<h2 id="bonds-butterfly">Bonds Butterfly</h2>
<p>With all these bearish expectations towards bonds, the market just needed
something to light the fuse. The catalyst was probably an auction of 7-year
bonds seeing record low demand. Remember from <a href="/bonds-2//bonds">last time</a> that bonds are
initially auctioned by the fed, so low demand would have caused these bonds have
a low price and a high yield. This in turn caused the associated but more common
5-year bonds to drop a whopping 0.75%.</p>
<p>This made a lot of people happy, as the <a href="https://finance.zacks.com/butterfly-fixed-income-trading-strategies-10170.html">2-5-10 butterfly</a> is a popular
trade:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The butterfly strategy involves buying both long and short-term bonds while
simultaneously selling medium-term bonds. This strategy is designed to help
investors profit from predicted fluctuations to the yield curve.</p>
<p>... The purchase and sales cancel each other out, making this a theoretically
zero-cost investment. This has the impact of cancelling out any shifts in the
overall values of the bonds unless the shifts are disproportionately weighted
to one maturity over another. When disproportionate shifts occur, the investor
can earn a net return. ...</p>
<p>One common butterfly trade involves three treasury bonds. The investor sells
five-year treasuries and buys two- and ten-year bonds with the money that he
receives in a proportion that makes the average life of the portfolio equal to
five years. To do this, the portfolio would be slightly more heavily weighted
towards the two-year bond. To begin with, the idea is for the blended yield of
the two- and ten-year bonds to be higher than the five-year bond&#39;s yield. The
other advantage of the butterfly is that if the relationship in yields
changes, it could increase returns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must be noted how <a href="https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/03/01/will-higher-interest-rates-kill-growth-stocks/">remarkable</a> these events are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tracy Alloway notes that, “The 2/5/10-year butterfly — a popular trade
involving two-, five- and 10-year U.S. bonds — moved by an astonishing 24
basis points (one of those events which, when measured by standard deviations,
is only supposed to happen once in a billion years, etc.).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/bonds-2/butterfly.png" alt="picture: 2-5-10 butterfly expected returns"></p>
<p>What I assume happened next is that traders unwound their positions to
capitalize on this sudden dip in the 5-years price. Since they were long
10-years bonds, that caused that price to also dip suddenly.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard — if not impossible — to tell, but this might have been the initial
shock that set the yield surge in motion.</p>
<h2 id="shorting">Shorting</h2>
<p>Another straightforward force multiplier to the move was short selling. I
talked about short selling in <a href="/bonds-2//gamestop">my article on Gamestop</a>, but basically
bond short-sellers borrow bonds, sell them, wait for the price to drop to buy
them back and return them to the original owner, pocketing the difference as
profit.</p>
<p>There was ample evidence of short selling in the bonds market. In particular,
the repo market rate for the 10-years bond went to -4% at some point... The what
now?</p>
<p>The repo or &quot;repurchase agreement&quot; market is where one party sells a security to
another, and agrees to repurchase it later at a higher price. Essentially, it&#39;s
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)">collateralized loan</a>.</p>
<p>The repo market allows financial institutions that own lots of securities (e.g.
banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds) to borrow cheaply and allows parties with
lots of spare cash (e.g. money market mutual funds) to earn a small return on
that cash without much risk, because securities, often U.S. Treasury securities,
serve as collateral.</p>

<p>The repo rate typically trades in line with the Federal Reserve’s benchmark
federal funds rate at which banks lend reserves to each other overnight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact it went to -4% means that people were willing to pay up to 4% interest
for the privilege to borrow 10 years bonds, with the intention to short them and
turn a profit. In that market, 4% is a lot, meaning there was a lot of
competitive pressure, hence a lot of short selling.</p>
<p>But wait! That&#39;s not all. We have another villain in our story in the form of
<em>convexity hedging</em>.</p>
<h2 id="duration-convexity--convexity-hedging">Duration, Convexity &amp; Convexity Hedging</h2>
<p>Some funds invest in mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Yes, those that caused
the great financial crisis and gave us the delightful movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgqG3ITMv1Q">The Big Short</a>
— check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbiDrzTd8fE">this excerpt</a> if you want Ryan Gosling to explain bad
mortgage-backed securities to you. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Anyway, when interest rates decrease, homeowners can refinance their mortgages
to lock in a lower rate. This involves paying off part of the remaining loan
immediately (hence it is called <em>prepaying</em>). This shortens the mortgages, and
as a result the average length of mortgages in the MBS decreases. This causes
the <em>duration</em> — the weighted average of the times until when cash flows (loan
repayments) are received — to go down. The opposite is also true: when interest
rates increase, people don&#39;t refinance, and so the average length of mortgages
goes up.</p>
<p>To explain how that impacts the bond market, we need to lay some groundwork.
Bonds have a property called <em>convexity</em> — when the interest rate decreases, the
price increases more than proportionally, and vice-versa.</p>
<p><img src="/bonds-2/convexity.png" alt="picture: Illustration of convexity in bond prices"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> It&#39;s always been unintuitive to me that bond price should rise
when interest fall (shouldn&#39;t it be the opposite?). So let&#39;s tackle that
first, then we can tackle the question of proportionality.</p>
<p>To key is that the rate increase will only affect newly emitted bonds. The
yield must be constant across all bonds with the same maturity (otherwise
it&#39;s an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp">arbitrage</a> opportunity). Adding new bonds with lower interest rates
tends to push the yield down, hence the price of existing bonds up!</p>
<p>It&#39;s not obvious that it would push the yield down. After all, a lackluster
auction could bid the new bonds up just enough so that the existing yield
doesn&#39;t move. It doesn&#39;t seem to work like that in practice, and I suspect
it&#39;s due to the new bonds shifting the expected future yield. As older,
higher-interest, bonds expire and newer, lower-interest, bonds are introduced,
it does make sense to expect the average yield to go down — at least when
ignoring fluctuations in the bond market, and excluding the possibility of a
sudden paradigm shift in bond valuation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So decreasing rates push bond price up. Why do they increase more than
proportionally to the decrease in rates? In one word: compounding — when the
yield moves, the price move must capture not only the change in coupon payments
but the proceeds of reinvesting these payments. For this reason, longer-term
bonds are more convex: more interest is being paid. At this point, I&#39;m ready to
launch in a long, fascinating (uhm) mathematical digression on yields,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_duration">duration</a>, compounding and [present value calculations], but this isn&#39;t really
the point of this piece. Maybe another time?</p>
<p>So bonds have <em>convexity</em>. Mortgage-backed securities, on the other hand, have
<em>negative convexity</em> (not sure why they didn&#39;t call this &quot;concavity&quot;, but
whatever). This means that as the interest rates fall, the price increase less
than proportionally, or even fall!</p>
<p>First, why would the prices go up? Same reason that the bond yields go up (see
above). Since government bonds are the ultimate risk-free security, most other
rates in the market depend on them, and will be higher. The difference between
the yield for a financial product and the risk-free rate (the bond yield) is
called <em>the risk premium</em>. So if bond yields go up, MBS yields are expected to
follow suit (at least if we assume that the reason that the yields went up has
no material impact on the mortgage market and the default rate).</p>
<p>The reason MBS prices go up less than proportionally (and in any case, less than
bond prices) is that, as we said at the start of this section, decreased rates
increase mortgage refinancing, which decreases MBS duration — the weighted (by
monetary amount) average time of received cashflows (loan repayments). More
refinancing and prepaying means less interest payments, though we will recover a
larger part of the principal earlier. What the MBS did offer us however was a
certain yield (based on the mortgage rate). When the duration decrease, we lose
on that yield, and must reinvest the prepaid sums elsewhere — right after the
interest rates went down! This loss in compound interest is what causes MBS
prices to rise less than expected.</p>
<p>So, bonds have convexity, mortgage-backed securities have negative convexity.
What is convexity hedging? It has to do with the facts that the funds that own
these MBS include things like pension funds, which have regular cash outflows
(e.g. to pay said pensions). This means the cashflows need to be regular. But
MBS cashflows vary with interest rates!</p>
<p>To take care of that unpredictability, these funds hedge for <em>duration</em>. Here&#39;s
how they do it: When interest rates increase, MBS duration increases, and funds
sell long-term bonds to cover liquidity needs; when rates decrease, MBS duration
decreases, and funds reinvest prepayments into long-term bonds.</p>
<p>Back to our initial topic, the net effect is that when interest rates increase,
MBS duration increases, which leads to funds selling off bonds to hedge
duration. The opposite happens when interest rates decrease. This naturally
amplifies the movement of bonds in either direction (as the bond price is
already on the upswing when interest rates decrease).</p>
<p>And with that, we completed our tour of the plausible reasons for the February
bond yield surge! Now we need to briefly examinate how this impacted the stock
market.</p>
<h2 id="inflation-redux">Inflation Redux</h2>
<p>Inflation means that money loses value. With inflation, a dollar in a year is
worth less than a dollar today. In an ideal world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow">spherical cows</a>, all
prices and wages would update instantly to reflect this new value of money.</p>
<p>If inflation worked like that, it would cause very little trouble. Sure, if
you&#39;re holding cash, you&#39;re suddenly poorer in terms of purchasing power.
Conversely, if you&#39;re holding debt, you&#39;re suddenly &quot;richer&quot; because your
repayments are worth less — and your revenues increased proportionally to
inflation anyway.</p>
<p>Alas, prices do not update instantly, and it&#39;s precisely this transition process
that is painful. Inflation works in wave. The first goods whose price increase
are those whose price is very liquid. The best example is commodities: ores,
oil, grains, etc. In fact, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2021/05/22/why-lumber-and-plywood-prices-are-so-high-and-when-they-will-come-down/">flare up in lumber price</a> has been in
the news quite a bit recently. It&#39;s probably unrelated to inflation, but it
shows how fast these prices can move.</p>
<p>Commodities are the very beginning of the supply chains involved in the
production of most goods. This means that, in the presence of inflation, the
increase in price slowly cascades through the supply chain. The increase in
price is not reflected immediately for two big reasons: existing commitments and
competition. If you already signed a contract to supply a good at a certain
price, you&#39;re stuck. If you&#39;re in a very dynamic market and you can change your
price, you might still not want to do so, because your competitors might not
have done so yet, and you&#39;ll lose customers to them. Of course, they&#39;ll have to
raise prices too eventually, but these effects slow down the price cascade —
it&#39;s a coordination problem. Where commodities are concerned, there&#39;s also
uncertainty as though whether a price increase is just a spike (possibly fueled
by speculation (*1)), or a more permanent shift.</p>
<p>At the end of the supply chain lies the final customer, the individual.
Unfortunately, wages are typically the last thing to increase in the inflation
process. This is because the price increase takes quite some time to reach final
consumers, and because the profits of a company must increase (after it can
reflect inflation in the price it charges) before it starts paying employees
more. And companies will tend to increase pay, if only to get a competitive
advantage by poaching promising talent.</p>
<p>(*1) This kind of speculation has, of course, unpleasant side-effects, such as
making lumber more expensive for those that have a genuine use for it. However,
I want to emphasize that this is the cost you pay for having an efficient
market, and an efficient market does buy you something. In particular, it
greatly reduces the time for inflation to cascade through the system, and hence
the economic pain that results from it. This is what the next section is all
about.</p>
<h2 id="what-inflation-does-to-companies">What inflation does to companies</h2>
<p>So inflation is a painful transition towards higher prices caused by a loss of
value of the currency. Inflation occurs when the balance of money and goods
shifts in the direction of there being more money and/or less goods. In the
current situation, there is more money in circulation due to stimulus and
massive public spending (*2), and a modest deficit for goods whose supply
chains were shut down during the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>(*2) At least in the United States, though it seems likely that other parts of
the world will suffer from, at least, a milder version of the same problem.</p>
<p>The consequence of this on companies is that they will go through a transition
period where their expenses will increase, but their revenues do not increase in
kind.</p>
<p>What, then, does inflation do to the valuation of companies? We mentioned two
things already. First, there is an impact on the balance sheet: cash loses
value, but so do debts. Second, there is a loss of profit due to price lag. In
some cases, those are straightforward to compute. In some cases not so much. On
top of this, there is the concern that this will put too much strain on the
company&#39;s finance, which will have to borrow at unattractive rates or, in the
worst case, be forced to liquidate.</p>
<p>So inflation is bad for everyone; but depending on balance sheet composition,
position within the supply chain and general financial health, it is worse for
some companies than for other. But wait — hasn&#39;t the S&amp;P 500 has been making
consistent all-time highs since the events of February?!</p>
<p>Clearly, to understand why growth stock got hammered in February, we need to
look beyond just the fundamental prices in the growth, and into the theory of
stock valuation.</p>
<h2 id="equity-risk-premiums-and-hurdle-rate">Equity Risk Premiums and Hurdle Rate</h2>
<p>Pricing the stock of a company is more art than science (otherwise they wouldn&#39;t
constantly be swinging around even when absolutely nothing of substance
happens). Nevertheless, many theoretical frameworks have been proposed to try to
explain the factors that underly stock prices, and to try to estimate what a
&quot;reasonable&quot; stock price may be.</p>
<p>This is quite the rabbit hole, and if you&#39;re interested, the best place to start
is Aswath Damodaran&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkh9m2BorqlJsEfix7R9jtSXClFZhGvC">valuation course</a>.</p>
<p>Two concepts that are particularly useful in analyzing the price of stocks are
the notion of <em>equity risk premium</em> and that of <em>hurdle rate</em>.</p>
<p>The equity risk premium is the (expected or actual) return on equities in excess
to that of the risk-free alternatives. Typically, treasury bonds are used as the
risk-free alternatives, the 10-year rate being the most commonly used. So if
10-year bonds have a 2% yield, and the stock market (for instance, the S&amp;P 500
index) returned 12%, then the equity risk premium was 10%. Typically, the equity
risk premium is calculated on historical data; there is obviously no guarantee
going into the future.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the <em>equity risk premium</em>, but the concept of <em>risk premium</em> generalizes
to other financial asset and even to sub-classes of stock. Of particular
interest to us here is the risk premium for growth stocks and the risk premium
for value stocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recall that value stocks are stocks who trade in line with a valuation
obtained through some kind of <em>fundamental analysis</em> process. The most common
of which is to use discounted flash flows (DCF): computing the present value
of the expected net profits of the company for some future period (typically
10 to 20 years). This approach is of course only applicable to profitable
companies.</p>
<p>Growth stocks, on the other hand, are companies whose revenues are growing a
lot (or are deemed to be poised to grow a lot), but who may not yet be
profitable. The valuation is based on future expectations of growth — which
may not come to pass and can sometimes be a bit too optimistic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the name implies, risk premiums are rewards for risk. Growth stocks are
riskier than value stocks, and so should command a higher risk premium. But what
is this &quot;risk&quot; we talk about? Consider that a risk premium is an average
computed on a basket of stock (or on an index) over a certain period of time.
Risk can be seen as the variance between the stocks in the basket, and the
variance over time. Growth stocks, for instance, are particularly risky: most
innovative companies end up failing, but those who survive tend to have
extraordinary growth.</p>
<p>The second important concept is the <em>hurdle rate</em>, which is simply the expected
return you demand to take on some amount of risk. Everybody will have its own
hurdle rates for different level of risks, though it tends to depend on possible
alternative uses of capital and risk-free rates of returns. Just like the risk
premium, the hurdle rate increases with perceived risk.</p>
<p>Putting the two concerns together is straightforward. Given a class of assets
(e.g. growth stocks) and their associated risks, you come up with a hurdle rate
(the return required to convince you to invest in the asset) and a risk premium
(the return you expect to earn on top of the risk-free rate). If the total
expected return for the asset (risk-free rate + risk premium) is higher than the
hurdle rate, you invest, otherwise you don&#39;t.</p>
<p>If you want a deeper and more data-driven take on inflation and stock valuation,
I recommend <a href="http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2021/03/rates-growth-and-value-investment.html">this article</a> by Aswath Damodaran. I don&#39;t
pretend to understand all of it, but it makes very interesting points.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened-to-growth-stocks">So what happened to growth stocks?</h2>
<p>It would be a stretch to say that, as bond yields rose, investors recomputed
their hurdle rate up (because the risk-free rate was up) and their expected risk
premium down (because inflation was likely, cutting into profits).</p>
<p>But on the other hand... Everyone knew that valuations in the growth segment
were historically high on any metric that you cared to consider. This meant the
category was particularly risky. Inflation comes in and maybe the risk is now
too high given the potential rewards. Better to lock in some profit. This is
essentially the hurdle/premium process, but perceived intuitively.</p>
<p>At this point, we also have to mention that inflation might be particularly bad
for the typically non-profitable growth companies, as it impedes their ability
to raise money. Not only does inflation expectation increase the interest rate
on debt, but it means that the money you borrow has lost value by the time you
spend it. Inflation also negatively affects the ability to raise cash via stock
sales: reflectively from the above, we expect inflation to negatively impact the
stock price, which mean that less money will be generated by selling (so you
need to sell more of it, which negatively impacts the stock price, ...).</p>
<p>As always whenever we talk markets, we have to consider force multipliers and
momentum. As growth stocks sold off in February, it became clear this that this
was not a mere fluctuation but a full-blown correction. This causes stockholders
that had not reacted to the bond market to start selling too, in reaction to the
price movement, but for the same reasons: the upside of continuing to hold
longer is limited compared to the immediate risk embedded in the downward trend.</p>
<p>Big moves in the stock market are also driven by de-leveraging: if you purchased
stock <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(finance)">on margin</a>, a sudden price drop forces you to sell stock to maintain your
<a href="https://www.firstrade.com/content/en-us/education/margin/marginrequirements/">margin requirements</a> and avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(finance)#Margin_call">margin calls</a>. This is especially relevant
since margin debt levels are historically high.</p>
<p><img src="/bonds-2/margin-debt.png" alt="picture: Margin debt chart"></p>
<p>The margin debt level may be in line with the S&amp;P 500 price, but note that you
would expect the debt ratio to decrease as stock prices go up. If you buy 5k$
worth of stock at 5:1 leverage (so fronting 1k$ of your own cash, taking a 4k$
margin debt), and the stock goes up 20%, your stock is now worth 6k$ and your
leverage ratio is now 3:1 (stock worth 6k$, of which 2k$ is not debt). One
<em>possible</em> interpretation of the chart is that as stock prices go up investors
reinvesting the profits with leverage (i.e. they maintain a constant leverage
ratio). Note that the chart also does not say where the leverage is deployed
(across the stock market? or is it concentrated in certain stocks?). In the end,
it seems that leverage will accentuate any &quot;natural&quot; price move, both in the up
and down directions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, what happened? What have we learned?</p>
<p>Bond prices decreases and the yield rose, driven by inflation expectations. A
series of events catalyzed (the 7-year bond auction) and amplified (the
butterfly trade, convexity hedging) this change.</p>
<p>The effect spilled over to the stock market, where it was mostly driven by
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsentiment.asp">sentiment</a>, reflecting both the increased risk-free rate and the lowered return
expectations due to inflation. Because growth stocks&#39; valuations were stretched,
that was all it took to tip this segment of the market into a correction.</p>
<p>When these events transpired, I did not get how inflation and the bond market
could influence stock valuation to this extent. In fact, some of my intuitions
were to the opposite. For instance, since companies will keep making money in
the future, shouldn&#39;t inflation push the stock price up to reflect the future
revenue increase due to higher prices?</p>
<p>I was also looking for a technical explanation (based on some mechanics of the
financial markets), whereas the move seems to have mostly been driven by
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsentiment.asp">sentiment</a> and risk-reward considerations. This happened on the heels of the
<a href="/bonds-2//gamestop">Gamestop gamma squeeze</a>, which had a straightforward technical explanation, so
there might be some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">availability bias</a> there.</p>
